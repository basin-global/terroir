The primary funding mechanisms, which any OG can utilize and are split between the OG and the protocol, are: a) ENSURANCE assets, b) SITUS accounts, and c) ENSURE, the nature-based currency.&#x20;\n\nAll accounts have transparent public viewing to see assets and currency in each account and other modules such as place, impact, and reputation that score each account based on certain metrics.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>How is this different than a domain or website?</summary>\n\nWhile names may resemble domains, they have nothing to do with DNS. They are unique onchain accounts solely controlled by the account owner and are transferable, salable, and burnable. These accounts can hold and transfer any type of value in the form of ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC20 assets. Accounts can be accessed and managed using any preferred method of connection to the Base Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain. They are not tied to any specific interface or provider and cannot be restricted or censored at the chain level.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Is this the same as ENS?</summary>\n\nSITUS Onchain Accounts are similar to ENS (Ethereum Name Service) but not related. They are unique text based immutable names tied to an account ID (#) and a dedicated 0x address for each account. ENS names require annual renewals whereas SITUS Accounts are one-time purchase with no renewal fees. ENS names can easily be configured to work with SITUS accounts ie elk.basin is configured with elk.basin-protocol.eth.&#x20;\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>How do I buy a name / account?</summary>\n\nVisit the OG (Onchain Group) of your choice and look for the CREATE page i.e. [https://ensitus.xyz/earth/accounts/create](https://ensitus.xyz/earth/accounts/create) and simply create your account. There are no limits to the number of groups you can join or the number of accounts you can have.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Can I sell or trade or delete my account?</summary>\n\nAbsolutely. You are in sole control of your account. Accounts can be sent, sold, traded, and even burned using most Ethereum wallets and platforms like SITUS, Opensea, and Rarible.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>How do I get a SITUS name for our city / location / group?</summary>\n\nAny group that is working to create place-based resilience can apply for a name.

indicators and metrics are of utmost importance to BASIN's natural capital investment approach.&#x20;\n\nWith the main goal of BASIN to make natural capital investable we primarily report and quantify in the language of finance: dollars. However, the main goal of **why** we need to make natural capital investable is to protect and restore ecosystems and their ecological function and integrity. In fact ecological indicators are a unit of value that bolster and are linked to financial value.\n\n### Indicator Methodologies and Frameworks\n\nThere are numerous ecological indicator and metric methodologies and frameworks ranging from ecosystem condition, ecosystem integrity, ecosystem characteristics, ecosystem services, biodiversity, biocomplexity, wildlife, habitat, species, and climate etc. We have compiled as many as possible in or [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/basinDAO/page/3HpgDaSba), reviewed them and are assimilating them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_IrNH\\_HgoqE8OfxI7wEH-0O-OLZpkb-2cdkIW5C-iKM/edit?usp=sharing). We invite other groups and individuals to collaborate on rationale, implementation, and best practices.\n\n### BASIN Ecological Indicators & Metrics\n\nAny of these 250+ indicators and metrics can be paired with the financial indicators from the [RealValue of Natural Capital](broken-reference) Framework to scale effective nature investment.\n\n{% embed url=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_IrNH_HgoqE8OfxI7wEH-0O-OLZpkb-2cdkIW5C-iKM/edit?usp=sharing\" %}\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/ecological-indicators-and-metrics.md", "sha": "39fe29417410a9ec0b715fa9f5da0a559f4a38b5", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/ecological-indicators-and-metrics.md"}}, {"content": "# Ecosystem Services Classification\n\n{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nThe BASIN [Core Benefits Framework](../../core-benefits/core-benefits-framework/) and the [RealValue of Natural Capital ](broken-reference)were built based on the process and supporting materials found in this Appendix.\n{% endhint %}\n\n## Ecosystem Services Classification & Valuation\n\nWe evaluated [over 50](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQwj56Qg699KpORHt\\_jm3YA43PAvEbwJuETykHpRhxM7YQ0ErbGIKcPZ0bc0a6R3mQlLx4rDGNTPCSy/pubhtml?gid=2071800547\\&single=true) ecosystem services classifications, ecosystem services valuations, natural capital and other impact/ESG benefits frameworks, narrowing our focus to nine key systems for cross-reference.

These systems are particularly relevant for ecosystem service valuation (ESV), corporate financial and ESG disclosures, applicability to real assets valuation as well as BASIN's conservation and restoration investment model. Several of them are grounded in seminal works like the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and TEEB, further attesting to their applicability and importance.\n\n## Cross Reference Table\n\n{% embed url=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQwj56Qg699KpORHt_jm3YA43PAvEbwJuETykHpRhxM7YQ0ErbGIKcPZ0bc0a6R3mQlLx4rDGNTPCSy/pubhtml?gid=744029972&single=true\" fullWidth=\"true\" %}\nSource: [BASIN RealValue Worksheet - Public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Ho1C5J2TCFnSJnkSbNXvBldMIUZGZyll3e6kSwazT4/edit?usp=sharing)\n{% endembed %}\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/ecosystem-services-classification/README.md", "sha": "dbf4b99443932c0e772e002b47b175291b48ab90", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/ecosystem-services-classification/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Ecosystem Services Classification\n\nOur comparative analysis of the selected ecosystem services frameworks revealed a consistent set of 19 top-level ecosystem services that were commonly referenced and utilized across all studies.

This service combines with other ecosystem services, including recreation-related services and noise attenuation services, to underpin amenity values. This is a final ecosystem service.\n\nSee Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.\n\n## CICES\n\nName Used: Physical & Experiential Interactions with Natural Environment\n\nService Category: Cultural\n\nDefinition: Physical and Experiential Interactions with Natural Environment refer to the various ways living and non-living elements of nature facilitate human activities focused on health, recuperation, or enjoyment. This includes characteristics of living systems that enable active or immersive interactions, as well as those that enable passive or observational interactions, each measured by the type of living system or environmental setting involved. Additionally, natural abiotic features that allow for both active and passive physical and experiential interactions are included, quantified by their types and amounts. These elements collectively enrich human well-being by providing opportunities for both physical engagement and mental restoration.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: No\n\nValuation Methods: n/a\n\nMetrics: included in definition\n\n## ESVD 2020\n\nName Used: Aesthetic information; Ornamental Resources\n\nService Category: Cultural; Provisioning\n\nDefinition: Aesthetic information as categorized by TEEB in ESVD include attractive landscapes.  Ornamental Resources includes Decorative Plants, Fashion, Decorations / Handicrafts, Pets and captive animals.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: Yes\n\nValuation Methods: The ESVD 2020 report offers a total of 4,042 value estimates, with 97 specific to Aesthetic information and 18 for Ornamental Resources. See the Valuation Methods Appendix. &#x20;\n\nMetrics: $/ha/yr; ESVD is working on other qualitative and quantitative metrics.\n\n## FEMA ESV 2022\n\nName Used: Aesthetic Value\n\nService Category: Information\n\nDefinition: Enjoying and appreciating the scenery, sounds, and smells of nature\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: Yes\n\nValuation Methods: Revealed Preference, Hedonic Pricing, Meta-Analysis, Contingent Valuation\n\nMetrics:&#x20;\n\nForest: Kousky & Walls (2013) evaluated the aesthetic benefits of the Meramac River greenway in St. Louis through a hedonic model that tied property values to proximity to the greenway. The original 2012 USD/year values were normalized to 2021 USD/acre/year. Similarly, McPherson et al. (2005) assessed aesthetic benefits of street and park trees in five U.S. cities. A hedonic price study was adapted through a biophysical model, and values were presented as 2005 USD net present value per city. These were then converted to 2021 USD/acre/year, focusing only on data from three cities due to limitations on canopy cover information.\n\nCoastal and Inland Wetlands: Ghermandi et al. (2010) performed a global meta-analysis on the value of wetlands, which was localized to the U.S. through a function transfer. The reduced model from the study, with 416 observations and an adjusted R^2 of 0.44, was used. Variables in the model were configured to align with U.S. conditions: 1) Non-coastal wetland variables were set to zero while estuarine and marine wetland variables were averaged (\\*\\*and the opposite for Inland\\*\\*); 2) The \"amenity and aesthetics\" variable was set to 1, with other ecosystem service variables set to zero; 3) U.S. GDP per capita was adjusted to match the model's unit requirements; 4) Average size of U.S. coastal wetlands was used for wetland size; 5) Remaining variables were set to their mean values. The dependent variable, originally in 2003 USD per hectare per year, was converted to 2021 USD per acre per year.\n\nUrban and Rural Green Open Space: Bockarjova et al. (2020) conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the value of green open spaces, resulting in a U.S.-specific valuation through a function transfer from their Model 2, which had an adjusted R^2 of 0.699. Variables were configured to fit U.S. conditions: 1) for urban \u201cPark\" and \"small urban green\" and for rural \u201cperi-urban greenspace\u201d variables were averaged, other types set to zero; 2) \"Aesthetics\" set to 1, other ecosystem service variables set to zero; 3) Current U.S. GDP per capita was adjusted for the model; 4) U.S. average population density was converted to model-specific units; 5) All other variables were averaged. The dependent variable, initially in 2016 USD per hectare per year, was converted to 2021 USD per acre per year. Lutzenhiser & Netusil (2001) segmented the general \"park\" category into specific types, and the average of urban and natural area parks was used for FEMA BCA valuation. The Trust for Public Land (2017) found that parks in Los Angeles increase nearby home values by 5%.\n\nRiparian: Qiu et al. (2006) used a hedonic pricing method to assess the added value of residential properties near riparian areas. This was validated using a contingent valuation survey to address biases in the econometric models. Berman & Armagost (2013) focused on the value increase of homes near freshwater resources in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, using sales data from 2009 to 2010. They found that riparian zones positively influenced property values. Similarly, Kousky & Walls (2014) conducted a hedonic analysis using sales data from 2008 to 2012 for households near the Meramec River in Missouri, confirming that proximity to the riparian area had a positive impact on property values.\n\nCoral Reefs: Brander and van Beukering (2013) utilized a function transfer to estimate the national value of coral reefs in the U.S. based on a meta-analysis with an adjusted R^2 of 0.44. Key model variables included average U.S. GDP per capita and the average area of coral cover in the U.S., and focused on the \"amenity\" ecosystem service. The findings were converted to 2021 USD per acre per year. Separately, Van Beukering et al. (2011) employed a hedonic price method to examine the impact of coral reef proximity on housing prices in the U.S. Virgin Islands. They identified a positive impact, quantifying it as an equivalent of $37 million annually.\n\nBeaches and Dunes: Landry et al. (2003) and Gopalakrishnan et al. (2011) both employed hedonic models to evaluate the aesthetic value of beaches and their management policies in Georgia and North Carolina, respectively. Landry et al. found preferences for wider beaches and aversions to armoring strategies and shoreline retreat. Gopalakrishnan et al. discovered that beach width significantly influenced property values, even more than previously thought, underscoring the importance of such features in the context of climate change and rising population densities in coastal regions. Both studies initially reported values in linear units or total value. These were later regularized to approximate areas using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for a more standardized comparison.\n\n## IPBES NCP\n\nName Used: Physical and psychological experiences\n\nService Category: Non-material NCP (Non-Material)\n\nDefinition: Provision, by landscapes, seascapes, habitats or organisms, of opportunities for physically and psychologically beneficial activities, healing, relaxation, recreation, leisure, tourism and aesthetic enjoyment based on the close contact with nature.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: No\n\nValuation Methods: n/a\n\nMetrics: Area of natural and traditional landscapes and seascapes\n\n## ENCORE\n\nNot classified in ENCORE as it is considered a Cultural Service.\n\n## TNFD Environmental Assets & Ecosystem Services\n\nUses SEEA EA\n\n## InVEST\n\nName Used: Scenic Quality &#x20;\n\nService Category: Visual and Scenic Quality &#x20;\n\nDefinition: Assesses and values the visual quality of landscapes based on sited or planned features.

This includes the regulation of atmospheric chemicals, measured by the contribution of specific types of living systems to the amounts or concentrations of these chemicals. Similarly, the control of temperature and humidity, including processes like ventilation and transpiration, is also governed by living systems and is quantified by their contributions to specific climatic parameters.

This includes smell reduction, noise attenuation, and visual screening, each regulated by different types of living systems such as specific plant or animal communities. These functions are measured by the type of living system involved in the mediation process. Additionally, the category includes abiotic structures or processes that also serve to mitigate nuisances, quantified by their types and amounts. Together, these biotic and abiotic elements work to alleviate the impact of human-generated nuisances on the environment and improve the quality of life.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: No\n\nValuation Methods: n/a\n\nMetrics: included in definition\n\n## ESVD 2020\n\nName Used: Air quality regulation\n\nService Category: Regulating\n\nDefinition: Air quality regulation as categorized by TEEB in ESVD include Capturing fine dust, Air quality regulation (unspecified), UVb-protection.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: Yes\n\nValuation Methods: The ESVD 2020 report offers a total of 4,042 value estimates, with 454 specific to air quality regulation.

In a 2013 study, the impact of forests on fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns was analyzed in 10 U.S. cities. This was monetized based on the avoided human mortality and morbidity costs, with values originally estimated in 2010 USD per square meter per year of tree cover, later converted to 2021 USD per acre per year. Similarly, a 2006 study examined how forests contribute to the removal of five different pollutants\u2014O3, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO\u2014in 55 cities. The value of these effects was quantified using monetized externality values that reflect societal costs of pollution, initially reported in 1994 USD and converted to 2021 figures. A 2014 study expanded on this to include both urban and rural forest impacts on air pollution removal across the conterminous U.S., also converting original 2010 USD figures to 2021 USD per acre per year. In both the 2013 and 2014 studies, dollar values for pollution reduction were sourced from the EPA, based on the agency's primary air quality standards.\n\nUrban Green Open Space: Gopalakrishnan et al.'s 2018 study and two local studies by the Trust for Public Land uniquely focus on the human health benefits derived from the pollution-removal capacity of vegetated areas. Utilizing the i-Tree Eco model and the EPA's BenMAP program, these studies explore the health impacts of various pollutants including ozone, nitrogen oxides, and particulates in several U.S. urban areas. An avoided cost approach is employed to quantify the value of these benefits, considering factors such as reduced respiratory illness, fewer emergency room visits, and lower hospital admission rates. The studies use the Leaf Area Index, percentage of land cover, and local air pollution data to assess the vegetation's impact on health. Economically, they follow a \"cost-of-illness\" method, factoring in expenses related to healthcare and loss of school days. &#x20;\n\nRiparian: Riparian areas contribute to air quality by filtering pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, among others. This value is calculated as an average of the benefits provided by forests and green open spaces. All methodologies in the cited studies employ an avoidance cost approach, factoring in the healthcare costs saved from reduced pollution-related illnesses. The absorption rates of pollutants are monetized based on market prices for alternative air purification methods. The benefits tend to be more significant in urban settings, and a more detailed breakdown comparing urban and rural areas could further refine the economic valuation of riparian zones for air quality.\n\n## IPBES NCP\n\nName Used: Regulation of air quality\n\nService Category: Regulating NCP (Regulation Of Environmental Processes)\n\nDefinition: Regulation by ecosystems, of CO2/O2 balance, O3, sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulates, aerosols, allergens.

From this, four key studies comprising 717 specific carbon sequestration values were selected to construct an average value estimate per acre per year. The valuation was then carried out using the social cost of carbon (SCC), which accounts for the societal impacts of each additional metric ton of carbon emissions, measured in CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The SCC rates are updated by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases and, for this study, the 2020 rate of $51 per metric ton CO2e was used, translating to $195.81 per metric ton of carbon in 2021 USD.&#x20;\n\nCoastal Wetlands: Carbon sequestration in U.S. coastal wetlands was evaluated using a two-step approach. First, an aggregate database containing over 6,000 carbon values was tapped to estimate average carbon sequestration rates per acre per year, selecting five studies that collectively included 72 individual values. Next, the social cost of carbon (SCC) was applied to attach a dollar value to the sequestration rates. SCC measures the societal costs of each additional metric ton of carbon emissions (CO2e), covering aspects such as agricultural loss, health impacts, and increased disaster risk. It is regularly updated by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, based on Executive Order 13990.53.

The original findings were reported in yearly values per city and in varying years' USD. These were then standardized by dividing by the total acreage of tree cover and converted to 2021 USD/acre/year. Wilson (2008) also evaluated the flood hazard reduction benefits of forests at a landscape scale using CITYgreen software. The original findings were in 2005 Canadian dollars per hectare per year and were likewise converted to 2021 USD/acre/year. &#x20;\n\nCoastal Wetland: Sun and Carson (2020) studied the economic impact of tropical storms on U.S. coastal areas, focusing on the role of wetlands in reducing storm hazard risks. The study covered 237 coastal counties and presented median values in 2016 USD/sq km/year, which were then converted and inflated to 2021 USD/acre/year. To derive a U.S.-specific valuation for wetlands, a function transfer method was applied, drawing from multiple meta-analyses including Adusumilli (2015), Brander et al. (2006), Ghermandi et al. (2010), and Woodward & Wui (2001). Specific variables were set to highlight the role of coastal wetlands and their contribution to flood or storm hazard risk reduction. Income per capita, wetland size, and GDP per capita were among the variables adapted to U.S. specific data. All these values were eventually converted to 2021 USD per acre per year.\n\nInland Wetlands: A function transfer method was used to tailor U.S.-specific wetland values based on meta-analyses by Adusumilli (2015), Brander et al. (2006), Ghermandi et al. (2010), and Woodward & Wui (2001). The focus was on freshwater or inland wetlands and their role in flood and storm hazard risk reduction. Variables like income per capita, wetland size, and GDP per capita were set to U.S. specific metrics. The \"publish\" variable for the Woodward and Wui (2001) study was set to 1, ensuring the results were based on published values. All the dependent variables, initially in various units and years, were standardized to 2021 USD per acre per year.\n\nUrban Green Open Space: The Trust for Public Land employed avoided cost methodology to assess the economic value of urban parks and open spaces in mitigating stormwater runoff. Using a model developed by the Western Research Station of the U.S. Forest Service, these studies leveraged geospatial land cover data and U.S. weather data on rainfall. The goal was to compare the water retention capacity of current land use versus that of a fully developed reference area. By correlating this information with water treatment data, the studies estimated cost-savings for city governments in terms of stormwater management.\n\nRiparian:  Rein (1999) analyzed the role of riparian buffers along rivers as temporary flood storage areas, particularly focusing on the Pajaro River near Elkhorn Slough. Using economic data from flood events in 1995 and 1998, Rein calculated the avoided future flood costs that could be achieved through installing these buffers. Similarly, Kousky & Walls (2013) used Hazus flood modeling software to estimate the avoided flood damages due to the conservation of riparian lands. Watson et al. (2016) went further by mapping flood extents for 10 real-life flood events and computing the damages that upstream riparian areas could potentially mitigate. &#x20;\n\nCoral Reefs: The study by Storlazzi et al. (2019) provided a comprehensive U.S.-wide estimate for the value of coral reefs in reducing storm hazard risks. The study was unique in its rigor, covering all U.S. areas and territories with associated coral reefs. The authors used high-resolution spatial and hydrodynamic modeling techniques similar to those employed by FEMA. Notably, the study considered both the value of at-risk infrastructure and the potential impacts to local economic activities, a factor often omitted in green infrastructure valuation. The methodology combined engineering, ecologic, geospatial, and economic modeling to quantify the coastal protection benefits of coral reefs across the U.S. and its territories.\n\n## IPBES NCP\n\nName Used: Regulation of hazards and extreme events\n\nService Category: Regulating NCP (Regulation Of Environmental Processes)\n\nDefinition: Regulation, by ecosystems, of the frequency, magnitude or impacts on people, of extreme events.

Pollinators, including a variety of bees and other insects, flourish in natural areas like grasslands and prairies. These ecosystems contribute to increased yields in croplands, and their conversion to agricultural land negatively impacts local pollination services. The study estimated the economic value of pollination at approximately $40 billion per year in the U.S. This figure includes the benefits of pollination not only for crop yields but also for the increased value of insect-pollinated legumes used in cattle feed. To arrive at this number, the study collected data across approximately 990 million acres of agricultural land, extending their analysis to include the benefits of pollination originating from open green spaces adjacent to these agricultural areas.\n\n## IPBES NCP\n\nName Used: Pollination and dispersal of seeds and other propagules\n\nService Category: Regulating NCP (Regulation Of Environmental Processes)\n\nDefinition: Facilitation by animals of movement of pollen among flowers, and dispersal of seeds, larvae or spores of organisms beneficial or harmful to humans.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: No\n\nValuation Methods: n/a\n\nMetrics: Pollinator diversity, Extent of natural habitat in agricultural areas\n\n## ENCORE\n\nName Used: Pollination\n\nService Category: Provisioning\n\nDefinition: Pollination services are provided by three main mechanisms: animals, water, and wind.

Additionally, natural abiotic features that allow for both active and passive physical and experiential interactions are included, quantified by their types and amounts. These elements collectively enrich human well-being by providing opportunities for both physical engagement and mental restoration.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: No\n\nValuation Methods: n/a\n\nMetrics: included in definition\n\n## ESVD 2020\n\nName Used: Opportunities for recreation and tourism&#x20;\n\nService Category: Cultural\n\nDefinition: Opportunities for recreation and tourism as categorized by TEEB in ESVD include Recreation, Tourism, Ecotourism, Hunting / fishing.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: Yes\n\nValuation Methods: The ESVD 2020 report offers a total of 4,042 value estimates, with 850 specific to Opportunities for recreation and tourism. See the Valuation Methods Appendix. &#x20;\n\nMetrics: $/ha/yr; ESVD is working on other qualitative and quantitative metrics.\n\n## FEMA ESV 2022\n\nName Used: Recreation/Tourism\n\nService Category: Information\n\nDefinition: Experiencing the natural world and enjoying outdoor activities\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: Yes\n\nValuation Methods: Travel Cost, Meta-Analysis, Market Price, Hedonic Price; Contingent Valuation; Replacement Cost; Choice Experiment\n\nMetrics:\n\nForest: Rosenberger et al. (2017) analyzed the consumer surplus value of U.S. recreation using travel cost studies. The study used the U.S. Forest Service's National Visitor Use Monitoring Survey to find the annual number and length of recreational trips to National Forest lands. The total annual trips were then multiplied by the average trip length and the dollar per trip consumer surplus, then divided by the total acreage of USFS lands to get a dollar-per-acre value. &#x20;\n\nCoastal Wetlands: Johnston et al. (2002) and Hazen and Sawyer (2008) evaluated the value of outdoor recreation activities in different U.S. geographies using travel cost and survey methods. The former focused on the Peconic Estuary System, noting that bird and wildlife watching, and recreational fishing were the most valued. The latter found that visitors to Florida's Indian River Lagoon spent more time in activities like fin fishing and power boating. Various meta-analyses were used to perform function transfers to construct U.S.-specific values on the economic value of wetlands. Adusumilli's model had an adjusted R^2 of 0.753, Brander et al. had 0.45, Ghermandi et al. had 0.44, and Woodward and Wui's chosen model had an R^2 of 0.582. Model variables were adjusted according to a set of guidelines, such as denoting types of wetlands, describing recreational activities, and factoring in economic indicators like income and GDP per capita. The results were converted to 2021 USD per acre per year.\n\nInland Wetland: A function transfer method was applied to construct a U.S.-specific value for the economic value of wetlands, drawing from several meta-analyses. Model C, with an R^2 of 0.582, was selected for the function transfer. The model variables were set as follows: 1) freshwater or inland wetlands variables were set to 1, others to 0; 2) variables related to recreational activities were set to 1; 3) income per capita variables, if present, were set to the U.S. average household income and converted as needed; 4) wetland size was set to the average size of U.S. inland freshwater wetlands; 5) GDP per capita variables were converted to the current U.S. GDP per capita; 6) for the Woodward and Wui study, \"publish\" was set to 1 to reflect published values; 7) remaining variables were set to their mean. The dependent variables, given in various dollar years and units, were converted to 2021 USD per acre per year.\n\nUrban Green Open Space: To improve the robustness of estimates for the recreation value of urban green open spaces, multiple methodologies were employed. First, U.S. values were used to estimate the meta-regression function presented in the comprehensive global contingent valuation literature review by Bockarjova et al. (2020). Secondly, Hanauer & Reid (2017) used an enhanced travel-cost method combined with detailed surveys and precise mapping techniques to assess the recreational value of urban open space. This multi-method approach aims to offer a more reliable and comprehensive understanding of the value of such spaces.\n\nRural Green Open Space: To estimate the monetary value of ecosystem services, particularly the recreation value of rural green open spaces, a mixed-method approach incorporating both stated and revealed preference methods is utilized. The first step involves using U.S. specific data to estimate the meta-regression function as provided by Bockarjova et al. (2020). This function itself is grounded in a comprehensive global review of the contingent valuation literature, a form of stated preference method. This combination of diverse methods aims to produce a more reliable and comprehensive valuation of rural green open spaces.\n\nRiparian: In studies examining various U.S. locations, the economic value of riparian habitats was highlighted. Rein (1999) noted that controlling erosion and nutrient deposition in Elkhorn Slough enhanced ecotourism like kayaking and birding. Colby & Smith-Incer (2005) found that maintaining riparian habitats in a California birding area was crucial for sustaining visitor numbers and the local economy. Weber & Berrens (2006) quantified the value of desert riparian recreation in Arizona's Aravaipa Canyon, emphasizing its role as a critical bird habitat. Across these studies, the conservation of riparian areas was shown to have direct economic benefits through sustained or increased recreational opportunities.\n\nBeaches and Dunes: In ecosystem service valuation, beach recreation has been rigorously studied. Various studies used a median value from seventeen different valuations to represent the U.S. context. The findings indicate that beach users value larger beach sizes but differ in how much they value this benefit based on their activities like fishing, boating, or swimming. People generally prefer wider beaches and are averse to armoring strategies like seawalls. Complementary services like safety measures, amenities, and water quality also significantly influence beach value and attendance. The studies used different metrics to report values, but Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were employed to regularize these into comparable units.\n\nShellfish Reefs: Studies on recreational angling over oyster reefs aim to quantify the willingness to pay either per household or per person. Oyster reefs serve as essential habitats for a variety of species, enhancing their recreational value. To calculate per-acre values, the $/household or $/person estimates were multiplied by the corresponding number of units, and the result was then divided by the study area. All figures were adjusted to 2021 USD.\n\nCoral Reefs: Brander and van Beukering (2013) conducted a meta-analysis on the value of U.S. coral reefs and derived a generalized national estimate using a reduced model with an adjusted R^2 of 0.44. Key model variables included average GDP per capita in the U.S., regional average hectares of coral cover, and a focus on \"all recreation activities.\" These were converted to 2021 USD per acre per year. Meanwhile, Van Beukering et al. (2011) focused on the U.S. Virgin Islands, using local economic data and tourist exit surveys. They applied the travel cost method to gauge consumer surplus from recreational tourism, and divided these annual values by the area of local coral reefs.\n\n## IPBES NCP\n\nName Used: Physical and psychological experiences\n\nService Category: Non-material NCP (Non-Material)\n\nDefinition: Provision, by landscapes, seascapes, habitats or organisms, of opportunities for physically and psychologically beneficial activities, healing, relaxation, recreation, leisure, tourism and aesthetic enjoyment based on the close contact with nature.\n\nEconomic Value Calculated: No\n\nValuation Methods: n/a\n\nMetrics: Area of natural and traditional landscapes and seascapes\n\n\n\nName Used: Regulation of freshwater quantity, location and timing\n\nService Category: Regulating NCP (Regulation Of Environmental Processes)\n\nDefinition: Regulation, by ecosystems, of the quantity, location and timing of the flow of surface and groundwater used for drinking, irrigation, transport, hydropower, and as the support of non-material contributions.

We selected Model C, featuring an R^2 of 0.582, as the foundation for our function transfer. Several variables were adjusted: those highlighting coastal wetlands and water quality were set to 1, average annual household income and U.S. GDP per capita were integrated where required, and 'publish' was set to 1 for Woodward & Wui\u2019s model to indicate reliance on published data. Finally, all monetary figures were converted to 2021 USD per acre per year.\n\nRiparian: Everard & Jevons (2010) examined the financial ramifications of water contamination from agriculture, particularly dairy farming, emphasizing the costs incurred by downstream communities to secure clean water. Zhongwei (2006) looked at how riparian buffers of different sizes (60 m, 90 m, 120 m) contribute to the filtration of nitrogen and phosphorus from upstream agricultural activities. The research used hydrological computer models like BASINS and HSPF along with GIS mapping for in-depth analysis. The findings from both studies offer valuable insights into water purification and associated costs.\n\nShellfish Reefs: Studies on U.S. shellfish beds reveal their significant role in water filtration by consuming nitrogen and phosphorus-rich plankton and detritus, thereby aiding nutrient cycling in coastal habitats. These studies employed replacement cost methods to value the filtration services provided by shellfish beds, comparing the cost of similar services if provided by wastewater treatment plants. The findings were initially reported as total benefits for each study site and were later converted to per-acre values by dividing the overall benefits by the area covered by shellfish within the site.\n\n## IPBES NCP\n\nName Used: Regulation of freshwater and coastal water quality\n\nService Category: Regulating NCP (Regulation Of Environmental Processes)\n\nDefinition: Regulation, by ecosystems, of the chemical composition of freshwater, groundwater and coastal waters, including through filtration, dilution, storage, accumulation, degradation or transformation of organic and inorganic matter, sediments and biogenic elements (N, P, Si, etc.).

The ENCORE Partnership, consisting of Global Canopy, UNEP FI, and UNEP-WCMC, maintains and updates the tool. This partnership was formerly known as The Natural Capital Finance Alliance (NCFA).\n\n## Ecosystem Services Categories\n\nEcosystem services were classified according to the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) which comprises a five-level hierarchical structure, for example: Section (e.g. Provisioning), Division (e.g. Nutrition), Group (e.g. Terrestrial plants and animals for food), Class (e.g. crops), and Class type (e.g. wheat). Cultural ecosystem services were not considered in this project as they are not considered to be direct inputs or to enable production processes.&#x20;\n\n## Ecosystem Services Classified\n\nFiltration\n\nFibers & Other Materials\n\nDisease Control\n\nClimate Regulation\n\nVentilation\n\nWater Flow Maintenance\n\nGround Water\n\nBuffering & Attenuation of Mass Flows\n\nWater Quality\n\nMediation of Sensory Impacts\n\nBioremediation\n\nSoil Quality\n\nPollination\n\nDilution By Atmosphere & Ecosystems\n\nSurface Water\n\nAnimal-Based Energy\n\nMass Stabilisation & Erosion Control\n\nMaintain Nursery Habitats\n\nGenetic Materials\n\nPest Control\n\nFlood & Storm Protection\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/ecosystem-services-classification/ecosystem-services-frameworks/exploring-natural-capital-opportunities-risks-and-exposure-encore.md", "sha": "467a85fe6c5d313fba743ec4aef525ded2eaafd0", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/ecosystem-services-classification/ecosystem-services-frameworks/exploring-natural-capital-opportunities-risks-and-exposure-encore.md"}}, {"content": "# FEMA Ecosystem Service Value Updates\n\nSource: FEMA [June 2022](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema/\\_ecosystem-service-value-updates/\\_2022.pdf)\n\n{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nPrimarily utilizes the seminal Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2001) categories.\n{% endhint %}\n\nFEMA has updated its approach to hazard mitigation by incorporating Ecosystem Service Values (ESV) into its Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) Toolkit, measured in terms of dollars per acre per year ($/ac/yr).

The inclusion of ESV not only makes the toolkit more comprehensive but also simplifies the application process for subapplicants seeking to implement Nature-Based Solutions (NBS).

The tool is used by a variety of entities like governments and corporations to evaluate trade-offs among multiple uses of natural resources. It offers models for different types of ecosystems like terrestrial, freshwater, and marine. The tool produces spatially-explicit models, outputting data in maps that can be tailored for local, regional, or global analyses. The models account for both the supply of services from ecosystems and the location of beneficiaries. Outputs can be in biophysical or economic terms, such as tons of carbon sequestered or its net present value. The Natural Capital Project aims to motivate greater investment in natural capital and incorporate its value into decision-making processes, aiming to shift the paradigm to one where natural capital is better understood and managed.\n\n## Ecosystem Service Categories\n\nInVest is a specialized tool that enables decision makers to assess quantified tradeoffs associated with alternative management choices and to identify areas where investment in natural capital can enhance human development and conservation.

The role of the atmosphere, ocean geomorphology, and water ecosystems in dilution processes is also key.\n* **Protection from Disruption**: Ecosystem services offer vital protection against natural disruptions, including habitat-based flood and storm protection and mass stabilization and erosion control through land geomorphology and soils.\n\n## **Swiss Re Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Index**\n\nThe Swiss Re BES Index further highlights critical dependencies across the industry's value chain:\n\n* **Manufacturing**: Essential services like pollination, air quality and local climate stabilization, water security, soil fertility, erosion control, and timber provision are vital for sustainable manufacturing.\n* **Wholesale/Retail**: The sustainability of products is enhanced by maintaining habitat intactness, in addition to the ecosystem services crucial for manufacturing.\n* **Transportation and Storage**: Efficient logistics and storage solutions depend on ecosystem services, such as air quality management, water security, and erosion control.\n* **Utilities and Waste Management**: Sustainable waste management practices are underpinned by similar dependencies on air quality, water security, and erosion control.\n\n## Applied to Core Benefits & Ecosystems\n\nThe Outdoor Apparel and Gear Industry, by its nature, interacts with a broad range of ecosystems, primarily through the sourcing of materials, the environmental impact of its manufacturing and supply chain processes, and the intended use of its products. However, its operations and the ecosystems it directly influences or relies upon can vary based on the materials sourced, the location of manufacturing facilities, and the focus of the product line. Below is an analysis of the ENCORE and Swiss RE dependencies aligned with the [Core Benefits of Natural Capital](broken-reference) and the [BASIN Ecosystems](../../../../core-benefits/core-benefits-framework/stocks-ecosystems/ecosystem-definitions.md) the industry likely operates in or impacts:\n\n### Dependencies on the Core Benefits of Natural Capital\n\n* **Clean Air**: Matches with air quality and local climate dependencies.\n* **Clean Water**: Directly relates to water quality and water security.\n* **Water Abundance**: Aligns with water security and the maintenance of water flow.\n* **Healthy Soils**: Ties to soil fertility and erosion control.\n* **Climate**: Broadly relates to local climate stabilization through various ecosystem services.\n* **Resilience**: While not directly listed, resilience can be inferred from flood and storm protection, mass stabilization, and erosion control services.\n* **Erosion Control**: Directly mentioned in dependencies.\n* **Biocontrol**: While not directly listed, biocontrol could be related to bioremediation efforts.\n* **Pollination**: Directly mentioned in dependencies.\n* **Habitat**: Relates to habitat intactness and the sourcing of fibers & materials.\n\n### Dependencies on Ecosystems Operated In or Impacted\n\n* **Cultivated & Developed**: The industry sources materials that may come from these areas, especially for natural fibers.\n* **Urban Open Space**: Less directly involved but may impact through retail locations and urban consumer engagement.\n* **Rural Open Space**: Involved in the sourcing of materials and possibly in conservation efforts.\n* **Rivers & Lakes**: Water sourcing and impact on water quality place these ecosystems as relevant.\n* **Inland Wetlands**: Important for water filtration and biodiversity, which can affect material sourcing and environmental strategies.\n* **Tropical Forest**: Source of specific natural fibers and materials; also a focus for conservation efforts due to biodiversity.\n* **Temperate Forest**: Similar to tropical forests in terms of sourcing and conservation.\n* **Boreal Forest**: Less commonly interacted with but could be involved in material sourcing or conservation.\n* **Coastal Systems**: Impact through pollution and conservation efforts, especially related to ocean plastics.\n* **Grasslands**: Can be involved in material sourcing, especially for natural fibers.\n* **Shrublands**: Less directly involved but may be impacted by or benefit from conservation efforts.\n* **Polar & Alpine**: Directly relevant for product testing, use, and sometimes material sourcing (e.g., wool).\n* **Desert**: May influence through material sourcing (e.g., certain natural fibers) and product use.\n* **Subterranean**: Less directly involved, although mining for minerals (for technical gear) can impact these areas.\n\nThis industry\u2019s footprint and reliance on ecosystem services underscore the importance of sustainable practices across all operational and impact levels. By understanding these dependencies and the ecosystems involved, the Outdoor Apparel and Gear Industry can better align its operations with environmental conservation and sustainability goals.\n\n## **Source Notes**\n\nThis analysis draws on public methodologies and data from ENCORE and Swiss Re, focusing on the direct potential dependencies and impacts of production processes on ecosystem services and natural capital assets.

Here's an overview of the frameworks we have considered, highlighting the primary systems we will utilize and providing summaries of additional frameworks for context.\n\n## Primary Industry Classification Frameworks\n\n### **SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)**\n\n* **Overview**: SASB provides industry-specific standards for reporting sustainability information relevant to financial performance. It identifies sustainability topics that are likely to affect financial condition or operating performance and provides standardized disclosure recommendations.\n* **Relevance to Natural Capital and ES Work**: SASB's focus on sustainability issues, including environmental risks and social governance factors, aligns closely with evaluating nature-related dependencies and impacts. Its industry-specific approach allows for targeted assessment and reporting, making it invaluable for identifying and communicating nature-related financial risks and opportunities.\n* **Used by** [**TNFD**](../ecosystem-services-classification/ecosystem-services-frameworks/tnfd-environmental-assets-and-ecosystem-services.md)\n\n### **GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)**\n\n* **Overview**: Developed jointly by MSCI and Standard & Poor's, GICS is a comprehensive industry classification system that categorizes companies into sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries. It is widely used in the financial sector for portfolio management, research, and market analysis.\n* **Relevance to Natural Capital and ES Work**: GICS's hierarchical structure and global acceptance make it effective for organizing companies according to their primary business activities. This facilitates the analysis of sector-specific nature-related risks and opportunities, essential for informed decision-making in investment and sustainability strategies.\n* **Used by** [**ENCORE**](../ecosystem-services-classification/ecosystem-services-frameworks/exploring-natural-capital-opportunities-risks-and-exposure-encore.md)\n\n### **NACE Rev. 2 (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community)**\n\n* **Overview**: NACE Rev. 2 is the European standard for classifying economic activities, offering a system to categorize entities based on their business operations. It is essential for statistical analysis, policy-making, and economic studies within the EU.\n* **Relevance to Natural Capital and ES Work**: Its detailed classification system enables precise identification of industries and sectors within the European context, aiding in the assessment of environmental impacts and dependencies. NACE Rev. 2 is particularly useful for aligning with EU policies and regulations regarding sustainability and environmental stewardship.\n* **Used by** [**Swiss Re BES Index**](../ecosystem-services-classification/ecosystem-services-frameworks/swiss-re-biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services-index-bes.md)\n\n## Other Considered Frameworks\n\n### **NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)**\n\n* **Summary**: NAICS is used by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to classify businesses for statistical purposes. It facilitates the collection and analysis of economic data across these countries. While comprehensive, its focus is more on statistical classification than on sustainability factors directly.\n\n### **ISIC 4 (International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4)**\n\n* **Summary**: Managed by the United Nations, ISIC is the most internationally comparable standard for economic data analysis, providing a framework for organizing economic activities. Its global scope is useful, but it lacks the specificity in sustainability and environmental factors that SASB or GICS provide.\n\n### **TRBC (Thomson Reuters Business Classification)**\n\n* **Summary**: TRBC offers a detailed and dynamic global industry classification system, used extensively in financial analysis. It provides granular insights but does not specifically focus on sustainability or environmental considerations.\n\n### **ICB (Industry Classification Benchmark)**\n\n* **Summary**: Developed by FTSE Russell, ICB categorizes companies and securities into industries and sectors. While it is widely used for stock market analysis, its focus is less directly on environmental and sustainability issues compared to SASB or GICS.\n\n***\n\nWhile all seven frameworks offer valuable insights into industry classification, SASB, GICS, and NACE Rev. 2 are chosen as the primary frameworks for BASIN Natural Capital's work due to their alignment with sustainability, environmental stewardship, and the specific nature of evaluating nature-related dependencies and impacts. The other frameworks, though considered, were found less directly applicable to the specific needs of natural capital and ecosystem services evaluation.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/ecosystem-services-dependencies-and-risks/industry-classifications.md", "sha": "cea71535ddf1cb0fb27201bfcdc5ed5c7c1e5e23", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/ecosystem-services-dependencies-and-risks/industry-classifications.md"}}, {"content": "# Industry Dependencies & Risks\n\nAt the core of BASIN\u2019s work to make natural capital investable, the common and persistent question is \u201cWho Pays and Why?\u201d As society and the economy are 100% part of and dependent on Nature, the straightforward answer should be that \u201ceverybody\u201d or \u201call of us\u201d pay to protect, restore, and steward Nature. However, this delves into the concept of externalities and the \u2018free rider\u2019 problems, which are not easily addressed.\n\n## The Bottom-line\n\nBASIN\u2019s thesis is that nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities are quantitatively connected to the financial bottom-lines of economies, industries, businesses, organizations, and families. While the qualitative aspects of these relationships are indeed significant, we view them as outcomes rather than the driving forces.\n\n## Financial and Economic Dependency and Risk Mapping\n\nThe assessment of financial dependencies and risks related to ecosystem services within industries primarily relies on data from the [ENCORE](https://www.encorenature.org/en) database. Three main frameworks (the ENCORE tool, S\\&P Nature Risk Profile, and the Swiss Re BES Index) utilize ENCORE data to examine sector and industry nature-related dependencies and risks. Additionally, the InVest tool is included for its utility in scenario, project, or site-specific analyses, despite its less industry-focused approach.\n\n{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nThe need for more comprehensive data and studies in this area is recognized, with the anticipation that TNFD reporting using [SASB](industry-classifications.md#sasb-sustainability-accounting-standards-board) Industry classification will provide a foundational base.\n{% endhint %}\n\n## Leading Frameworks\n\nThese tools and frameworks represent the leading efforts in addressing the nature-related financial and economic complexities. (ENCORE, BES Index, and InVEST are also covered in the Ecosystem Services Classification [Appendix](../ecosystem-services-classification/).)\n\n### ENCORE Tool\n\nThis tool is designed to help organizations, particularly in the financial sector, understand their natural capital risks and dependencies. It categorizes how business sectors and processes impact nature, focusing on lending, underwriting, and investments in high-risk industries. ENCORE introduces users to nature-related financial disclosure frameworks, including a special biodiversity module for agriculture and mining sectors. ENCORE uses the [GICS](industry-classifications.md#gics-global-industry-classification-standard) industry classification.\n\n#### Natural Capital Assets and Ecosystem Services Industry Dependencies\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/encore - flow chart.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### S\\&P Nature Risk Profile\n\nLaunched in collaboration with the UN Environment Programme, this methodology aids the financial sector in measuring and managing nature-related risks. It provides analytics on nature impacts and dependencies, aligning with the TNFD disclosure framework. The approach includes the Ecosystem Footprint metric, combining land impact, ecosystem degradation, and significance to evaluate a company's impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services. S\\&P uses the [GICS](industry-classifications.md#gics-global-industry-classification-standard) industry classification.\n\n#### Ecosystem Dependency Score\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/s&#x26;p.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### Swiss Re BES Index\n\nThe Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Index evaluates the dependency of economic sectors on nature and assesses countries' exposure to biodiversity and ecosystem service decline. This index supports the reinsurance business case and measures nature's value, identifying sectors most reliant on natural capital. Swiss Re uses the [NACE](industry-classifications.md#nace-rev.-2-statistical-classification-of-economic-activities-in-the-european-community) industry classification.\n\n#### Sector Dependency\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/swiss-re-bes-2.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### InVEST\n\nDeveloped by the Natural Capital Project, InVest is an open-source software suite for mapping and valuing crucial ecosystem services. It produces spatially-explicit models to support decision-making in resource management across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. The tool is geared towards a broad user base, including governments and corporations, facilitating the integration of natural capital value into decision-making processes.\n\n***\n\nEach framework via their own approach plays a vital role in mapping industry dependencies on ecosystem services and identifying the associated financial and economic risks.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/ecosystem-services-dependencies-and-risks/industry-dependencies-and-risks.md", "sha": "78aff355be72762fb305b521182941f4ffd33657", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/ecosystem-services-dependencies-and-risks/industry-dependencies-and-risks.md"}}, {"content": "# Glossary\n\n{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nThis section is an evolving work in process.\n{% endhint %}\n\nCompilation of regularly used terms and phrases in BASIN. Third-party sources are in _italics_ as applicable.\n\n## 0\n\n### **0xSplits**\n\n0xSplits or Splits is a decentralized protocol utilizing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts (EVM) to automate the splitting of on-chain income among multiple recipients. It enables trustless, composable, and fee-less (apart from gas costs) distribution of funds according to predefined ratios. Designed for versatility, 0xSplits can be used for various purposes, including revenue sharing among project contributors, community fund management, and more. The protocol is open-source, audited, non-upgradeable, ensuring reliability and permanence as a foundational infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\n## 3\n\n### 30x30 (30 by 30)\n\nThe \"30x30\" initiative, also known as \"30 by 30,\" is a global conservation goal that aims to protect at least 30% of the world's land and oceans by the year 2030. This initiative recognizes the critical importance of preserving natural habitats and biodiversity to address environmental challenges such as climate change, habitat loss, and species extinction. By setting aside 30% of the Earth's land and oceans as protected areas or conservation zones, the 30x30 initiative seeks to promote ecosystem resilience, safeguard endangered species, and maintain the health of vital ecosystems. This goal aligns with broader conservation and sustainability efforts to ensure the long-term well-being of both humanity and the planet. Related: [Half Earth](glossary.md#half-earth)\n\n## A\n\n### Aave&#x20;\n\nAave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol operating on Ethereum that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies. It eliminates traditional financial intermediaries, allowing users to deposit assets into liquidity pools for lending and borrowers to access loans with collateral. Aave has introduced innovations like flash loans and employs its native cryptocurrency, AAVE, for governance and collateral. It plays a key role in the growth of DeFi by providing efficient and accessible cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services.&#x20;\n\n### Adaptive Capacity&#x20;\n\nAdaptive capacity refers to the ability of societies, ecosystems, and individuals to respond effectively to the impacts of environmental changes, including those related to climate change and biodiversity loss. In the context of IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), adaptive capacity is a crucial concept for assessing and addressing the challenges posed by environmental changes. &#x20;\n\n### Additionality&#x20;\n\nAdditionality is a fundamental concept in environmental and conservation contexts, serving as a criterion to assess the true impact of initiatives and projects. In the realm of carbon offsetting, it scrutinizes whether emission reductions or removals achieved are genuinely additional to what would have naturally occurred or been legally required, ensuring the legitimacy of carbon credits. Similarly, in biodiversity conservation, it evaluates whether conservation actions result in a net increase in biodiversity compared to a no-intervention scenario, safeguarding the integrity of conservation efforts. Conservation finance also relies on additionality to confirm that investments lead to heightened conservation activities beyond the status quo. This concept plays a pivotal role in verifying the effectiveness of environmental endeavors, preventing double-counting of benefits, and directing resources toward meaningful solutions to environmental challenges. &#x20;\n\n### Area of influence&#x20;\n\nThe project area of influence is generally larger than the physical footprint of the project, and includes the area within which a project may potentially directly, indirectly, and cumulatively cause impacts to nature. _TNFD; IFC_&#x20;\n\n### Atmosphere&#x20;\n\nAtmosphere includes the gaseous medium and its suspended particulate liquids and solids above the land realm, extending to the altitudinal limits of life. _TNFD_\n\n## B\n\n### Baseline&#x20;\n\nStarting point or benchmark against which changes in the state of nature attributed to your business activities can be compared. _TNFD; Natural Capital Protocol_\n\n### basinDAO&#x20;\n\nAfter the Core Benefits Label Climate Sprint in the fall 2021, a small group formed a DAO called CMPND. CMPND was established to apply the CBL to assessing and developing climate projects as a venture studio. Realizing this was too general, CMPND was renamed basinDAO. basinDAO was the first iteration of what is now the BASIN Protocol. While we no longer use the term DAO, BASIN is similar to a DAO in that it is a polycentric organization operated by its members.\n\n### **Biocomplexity**\n\nA multidisciplinary field that examines the intricate interactions and emergent properties among biological, ecological, social, and technological systems. Biocomplexity studies the dynamics and nonlinear relationships within and between various levels of biological organization, from genetic diversity within species to ecosystem diversity across landscapes. It emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of life and environments, aiming to understand the resilience, adaptability, and sustainability of living systems in the face of ecological, environmental, and societal challenges. This field underlines the critical importance of holistic approaches in conservation, restoration, and sustainable management practices. Related: [SEED Biocomplexity](glossary.md#seed-biocomplexity)\n\n### Biocredit&#x20;\n\na concept used to quantify and trade the ecological benefits or credits generated by conservation projects or initiatives aimed at preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. These credits represent the positive impacts of such projects on biodiversity, habitat protection, or ecosystem restoration. Biocredits can be bought and sold as a mechanism to support conservation efforts, similar to carbon credits in the context of carbon offsetting. They encourage investment in conservation and sustainable land management practices, helping to safeguard biodiversity and promote ecological sustainability.&#x20;\n\n### Biodiversity&#x20;\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) definition is: \"The variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.\" BASIN emphasizes that this definition includes not just the diversity within and between species, but also extends to the diverse ecological roles and interactions within the ecosystems, incorporating both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. BASIN places particular emphasis on the ecosystems themselves and the complex interrelationships, recognizing that organisms and species cannot exist in isolation from the ecosystems and habitat that sustain them. _TNFD; BASIN_&#x20;\n\n### Biodiversity Credit&#x20;\n\nA biodiversity credit is a tradable unit representing a quantifiable and verified conservation or enhancement of biodiversity in a specific area. Biodiversity credits are part of market-based mechanisms designed to promote biodiversity conservation and offset the negative impacts of development or land use changes. These credits are generated through activities such as habitat restoration, species protection, or land preservation and can be bought and sold to compensate for biodiversity losses in other locations, providing a financial incentive for conservation efforts. Biodiversity credits aim to balance economic development with biodiversity preservation and are often used in regulatory frameworks like biodiversity offset programs.&#x20;\n\n### Biodiversity Net Gain&#x20;\n\na conservation approach and policy framework applied to development and land-use planning. This concept mandates that development projects must not only avoid harming biodiversity but also result in a quantifiable increase in biodiversity and habitat quality compared to the pre-development state. Under this principle, developers and landowners are required to assess the biodiversity value of a site before commencing any development activities. Subsequently, they must implement measures to enhance or restore biodiversity, often through activities such as habitat creation and native vegetation planting. Biodiversity net gain aligns with environmental objectives, recognizing the crucial role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health and resilience while promoting sustainable economic development.&#x20;\n\n### Biodiversity Offset&#x20;\n\na conservation or restoration action taken to compensate for the adverse impacts on biodiversity resulting from development or land use changes in one location. The purpose of a biodiversity offset is to achieve \"no net loss\" or even a \"net gain\" of biodiversity by ensuring that the negative effects of a project on ecosystems, species, or habitats are balanced by conservation efforts elsewhere. Biodiversity offsets typically involve the restoration, protection, or creation of habitats or ecosystems of similar ecological value to those affected by development. These offset measures aim to contribute to the overall conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. Biodiversity offsets are often required by regulatory authorities to mitigate the environmental impact of development projects.\n\n### Biome&#x20;\n\nGlobal-scale zones, generally defined by the type of plant life that they support in response to average rainfall and temperature patterns e.g., tundra, coral reefs or savannas. _TNFD; IPBES_\n\n### Bundling&#x20;\n\nBundling involves grouping multiple ecosystem services or benefits together into a unified package for valuation or compensation. This approach acknowledges the interconnectedness of different ecosystem services and assesses their collective value, rather than evaluating each service separately. Bundling recognizes the combined benefits provided by ecosystems and is used to support comprehensive ecosystem valuation and management. Bundling Example: Instead of valuing flood regulation, water purification, and habitat separately, a wetland ecosystem's combined benefits are assessed and compensated as a single package. Related: [Stacking](glossary.md#stacking)\n\n## C\n\n### Climate Adaptation&#x20;\n\nClimate Adaptation is the process of adjusting to and preparing for the impacts of climate change. It involves developing strategies and implementing measures to reduce the vulnerability of individuals, communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure to climate-related risks. Climate adaptation aims to enhance resilience and ensure that societies can effectively respond to and recover from the changing climate. Adaptation efforts may include building resilient infrastructure, protecting natural ecosystems, implementing water management practices, and developing early warning systems to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and other climate-related challenges.&#x20;\n\n### Climate Finance&#x20;\n\nClimate Finance is the allocation of financial resources, investments, and funding mechanisms to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts at local, national, and global levels. It encompasses a diverse array of financial instruments, including public funds, private investments, grants, loans, and market-based mechanisms like carbon trading. Climate finance aims to address the challenges posed by climate change by funding projects and initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance climate resilience, and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. It plays a critical role in supporting developing countries in their efforts to combat climate change and fulfill their climate-related commitments under international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Climate finance is instrumental in advancing climate action and facilitating the transformation towards a more sustainable and climate-resilient future.&#x20;\n\n### Climate Lease\n\nDeveloped by Thomas Morgan, CCIM, the Climate Lease introduces a financial strategy from investment real estate to environmental conservation, leading to the innovation of [Ecological Ensurance](broken-reference). The climate lease, which has also been referred to as biodiversity lease, habitat lease, carbon lease, net zero lease, nature lease, conservation lease, and resilience lease, borrows from the global commercial real estate market the financial model that utilizes leasing instead of owning to enhance capital efficiency and minimize opportunity costs for conservation funders and entities dependent on ecosystem services. By leasing environmental assets funders can invest more projects, achieving better overall returns than if they were to allocate capital towards owning these assets. This leasing model provides the benefits of environmental stewardship without the upfront cost and financial burdens of ownership, encouraging investment in conservation. Ecological Ensurance is a derivative model of this that calculates the residual value of the real estate at zero which allows the land/property/ecosystem to go into permanent trust. Payments made under these long-term leases motivate real asset and income investors to support environmental projects, as they get market rate yields while knowing the land will ultimately be preserved in a trust. This ensures permanent protection for the leased ecosystems, offering a sustainable model for combining economic and environmental goals.\n\n### Climate Mitigation&#x20;\n\nClimate Mitigation is actions and strategies aimed at reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases and other drivers of climate change. The primary goal of climate mitigation is to limit the extent of global warming and its associated impacts on the environment and human societies. Mitigation efforts encompass a wide range of activities, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, implementing sustainable land-use practices, and adopting policies to reduce emissions from industries and transportation. Climate mitigation is a critical component of global efforts to combat climate change and achieve international climate targets, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement.&#x20;\n\n### Climate Resilience&#x20;\n\nClimate Resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, ecosystems, and systems to withstand and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change while maintaining essential functions. It involves strategies and measures aimed at reducing vulnerability to climate-related risks, enhancing adaptive capabilities, and ensuring the ability to recover from climate impacts. Climate resilience is crucial for safeguarding human well-being, ecosystems, infrastructure, and economies in the face of a changing climate, including extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and sea-level rise.&#x20;\n\n### Climate Sprint\n\nA Climate Sprint is a focused, three-week initiative designed by John Sanchez, aimed at immersing participants in tangible climate projects. It encourages a deep dive into climate solutions through learning, engaging with stakeholders, and team brainstorming towards a specific goal. This structured program offers accountability, collaboration, and a short, impactful timeline for those looking to explore or deepen their involvement in the climate field. John Sanchez, a Harvard undergrad on a gap year dedicated to climate change efforts, founded Climate Sprints to facilitate a hands-on approach to addressing climate challenges.\n\n### Co-benefits&#x20;\n\nCo-benefits associated with carbon reduction efforts are the positive side effects that go beyond addressing climate change. These co-benefits touch various aspects of society and the environment. One of the most notable is improved air quality, as actions to reduce carbon emissions often lead to decreased levels of harmful pollutants, benefiting public health by reducing respiratory illnesses and healthcare costs. Additionally, such efforts often promote energy efficiency, resulting in lower energy consumption, cost savings, and enhanced energy security. The transition to a low-carbon economy can also create jobs, contributing to economic growth. Biodiversity and ecosystems benefit from carbon reduction measures by preserving habitats and reducing resource exploitation. Moreover, these actions enhance community resilience and social equity, ensuring that the advantages of carbon mitigation are shared broadly, especially among marginalized populations. Recognizing these co-benefits underscores the importance of comprehensive climate strategies that yield numerous positive outcomes for society and the environment.\n\n### Co-Benefits Climate Sprint\n\nIn August 2021, the Climate Sprint focused on the valuation of long-term co-benefits and ecosystem services within climate finance. Participants were tasked with developing methods to identify, rate, and price the additional benefits of carbon projects. The teams worked on integrating these values into climate finance initiatives, aiming to align them with climate, financial, ESG, and impact goals. This Sprint covered areas such as carbon removal, climate adaptation, conservation, emissions reduction, energy transition, and climate justice, targeting a wide range of stakeholders. The final deliverables included a valuation system for co-benefits, a detailed project scope, and a pitch targeting potential investors or participants, designed to demonstrate the project's viability, scalability, and impact. Open to anyone with an interest in climate and conservation finance, the Sprint emphasized practical, scalable solutions for incorporating ecosystem services into climate projects. This Climate Sprint resulted in the Core Benefits Label.\n\n### Common Asset Trust&#x20;\n\nCommon Asset Trust is a governance mechanism designed to manage common-pool resources, such as forests, fisheries, or water bodies, in a sustainable and equitable manner. CATs are informed by Ostrom's principles of collective action and self-governance, which emphasize the role of local communities and resource users in making and enforcing rules for resource management.&#x20;\n\n### Common Pool Resources&#x20;\n\nCommon Pool Resources are resources collectively owned or accessed by a group, where one person's use diminishes what's available to others. CPRs include resources like fisheries and forests. Effective management often involves local communities creating rules for sustainable use and distribution, as highlighted by Elinor Ostrom's research.\n\n### Conservation Finance&#x20;\n\nConservation Finance the strategic and innovative use of financial mechanisms and instruments to support the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources, biodiversity, and ecosystems. This field blends financial strategies with conservation goals to secure funding for initiatives that protect and restore the environment. Conservation finance encompasses a wide range of approaches, including public and private investments, impact investing, environmental markets, eco-tourism, and the development of financial tools like green bonds and payment for ecosystem services programs. The primary objective of conservation finance is to generate sustainable funding streams for conservation efforts while promoting biodiversity conservation, habitat restoration, and the sustainable use of natural resources. It plays a crucial role in addressing pressing environmental challenges and achieving long-term ecological and societal benefits.\n\n### Core Benefits Label\n\nBased on the 2021 [Co-Benefits Climate Sprint](glossary.md#co-benefits-climate-sprint) which set out to answer \"**How can we best value long-term co-benefits and ecosystem services when mobilizing climate finance?\",** the Core Benefits Label aimed to make the valuation of ecosystem services and co-benefits in climate finance more understandable and actionable. It detailed efforts by a diverse team to value long-term co-benefits for net-zero companies and stakeholders through a \"Climate Sprint\" approach for rapid, collaborative development. The concept of a \"Core Benefits Label,\" similar to nutrition labels, was proposed to assist investors in identifying climate projects with significant ecological and social impacts, aiming to improve how such projects are evaluated for their broader benefits beyond carbon reduction.\n\n### Costanza, Robert\n\nRobert Costanza is a notable ecological economist and environmental scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of ecological economics. His work focuses on the valuation of ecosystem services, the redefinition of traditional economic indicators to include ecological and social dimensions in assessments of well-being, and the promotion of interdisciplinary approaches to address sustainability challenges. Costanza's advocacy for the recognition of natural capital value and his leadership in advancing ecological economics have had a profound impact on the fields of economics, environmental science, and sustainability.&#x20;\n\n### Critical habitat&#x20;\n\nAny area of the planet with high biodiversity conservation significance, based on the existence of habitat of significant importance to critically endangered or endangered species, restricted range or endemic species, globally significant concentrations of migratory and/or congregatory species, highly threatened and/or unique ecosystems and key evolutionary processes. _TNFD; IFC_&#x20;\n\n### Cumulative impact&#x20;\n\nA change in the state of nature (direct or indirect) that occurs due to the interaction of activities of different actors operating in a landscape. _TNFD_\n\n\n\n## D\n\n### **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**\n\nA DAO operates as a blockchain-based form of organization or company governed by smart contracts, eliminating the need for traditional management structures. DAOs are democratic systems where decisions are made through member voting, ensuring transparency and direct stakeholder control. This structure enables decentralized decision-making and management, making DAOs ideal for collaborative projects, investment funds, and community-led initiatives. DAOs represent a shift towards more open, equitable, and efficient ways of organizing collective efforts and resources.\n\n### Dasgupta Review&#x20;\n\nThe Dasgupta Review, officially titled the \"Review on the Economics of Biodiversity,\" is a comprehensive report led by economist Sir Partha Dasgupta and published in 2021. Commissioned by the UK government, it assesses the economic implications of biodiversity loss and the decline of natural capital. This review underscores the profound connection between nature, economics, and human well-being. It emphasizes the vital role of natural capital, which includes ecosystems and biodiversity, as one of the three types of capital crucial for economic prosperity, alongside human capital and produced capital. The report highlights that the degradation of natural capital poses significant risks to economies and societies globally. Key takeaways from the Dasgupta Review include the urgent need to account for natural capital in economic decision-making, adopt sustainable economic models, and prioritize investments in nature conservation and restoration. By recognizing the value of nature as a vital component of our economic infrastructure, the review calls for transformative changes in how we perceive, manage, and invest in natural resources.&#x20;\n\n### de Groot, Rudolph&#x20;\n\nRudolph de Groot is a notable figure in the field of ecosystem services and environmental economics. He is recognized for his contributions to the valuation and assessment of ecosystem services and for promoting their integration into decision-making processes. De Groot's work focuses on assigning economic values to the benefits provided by natural ecosystems and advocating for the incorporation of ecosystem service assessments into land use planning, policy development, and resource management. His interdisciplinary approach and leadership have influenced the understanding of the ecological and economic dimensions of environmental challenges, with practical applications in environmental management, conservation, and sustainable development.&#x20;\n\n### DeFi&#x20;\n\nDeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, a blockchain-based financial system that offers traditional financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and asset management without relying on traditional intermediaries like banks. Instead, it utilizes smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to enable peer-to-peer transactions, making financial services more accessible, transparent, and open to a global audience. DeFi has gained prominence in the cryptocurrency space for its potential to disrupt traditional finance and increase financial inclusion.&#x20;\n\n### Dependencies&#x20;\n\nAspects of ecosystem services that an organisation or other actor relies on to function. Dependencies include ecosystems' ability to regulate water flow, water quality, and hazards like fires and floods; provide a suitable habitat for pollinators (who in turn provide a service directly to economies), and sequester carbon (in terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms). _TNFD; SBTN_&#x20;\n\n### Dependency pathway&#x20;\n\nA dependency pathway shows how a particular business activity depends upon specific features of natural capital. It identifies how observed or potential changes in natural capital affect the costs and/or benefits of doing business. _TNFD; Natural Capital Protocol_\n\n### Direct impacts&#x20;\n\nA change in the state of nature caused by a business activity with a direct causal link. _TNFD_\n\n## Drivers of nature change&#x20;\n\nAll external factors that affect nature, anthropogenic assets, nature's contributions to people and good quality of life. They include institutions and governance systems and other indirect drivers, and direct drivers (both natural and anthropogenic). _TNFD; IPBES_\n\n## E\n\n### Ecocredit\n\nIn the Regen Network, an \"ecocredit\" represents a digital certificate issued for specific ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration or biodiversity conservation, verified by the network. These credits are created to incentivize and quantify ecological regeneration and conservation efforts. They can be bought, traded, and retired by individuals and organizations looking to offset their carbon footprint, invest in sustainable practices, or meet climate commitments. The system provides a transparent, blockchain-based platform for valuing and transacting in ecosystem services, contributing to global environmental sustainability goals.\n\n### Ecological / habitat connectivity&#x20;\n\nThe degree to which the landscape facilitates the movement of organisms (animals, plant reproductive structures, pollen, pollinators, spores, etc.) and other environmentally important resources (e.g. nutrients and moisture) between similar habitats. Connectivity is hampered by fragmentation. _TNFD; IPBES_&#x20;\n\n### Ecological Economics&#x20;\n\nEcological economics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates principles from economics and ecology to address sustainability challenges. It emphasizes long-term well-being, recognizes the interconnectedness of economic and ecological systems, values ecosystem services, considers ethical and social aspects, and provides guidance for sustainable resource management and environmental policy development. Ecological economics aims to balance economic goals with the preservation of finite natural resources and ecosystems.\n\n### Ecosystem&#x20;\n\nA dynamic complex of plant, animal and microorganism communities and the non-living environment, interacting as a functional unit. _CBD; IPBES; TNFD_&#x20;\n\n### Ecosystem Accounting&#x20;\n\nEcosystem accounting is a specialized form of environmental accounting that focuses on the measurement and valuation of ecosystem services provided by natural ecosystems. It involves systematically assessing the contributions of ecosystems to the economy and human well-being. Ecosystem accounting quantifies the various benefits that ecosystems offer, such as clean water, pollination, carbon sequestration, and habitat provision. By integrating this information into economic frameworks, ecosystem accounting helps policymakers and businesses make informed decisions that balance economic development with the sustainable use and conservation of ecosystems.&#x20;\n\n### Ecosystem Asset&#x20;\n\nA form of environmental assets that relate to diverse ecosystems. These are contiguous spaces of a specific ecosystem type characterised by a distinct set of biotic and abiotic components and their interactions. _SEEA; TNFD_&#x20;\n\n### Ecosystem Condition&#x20;\n\nThe quality of an ecosystem measured by its abiotic and biotic characteristics. Condition is assessed by an ecosystem's composition, structure and function which, in turn, underpins the ecological integrity of the ecosystem, and supports its capacity to supply ecosystem services on an ongoing basis. _SEEA; TNFD_&#x20;\n\n### Ecosystem function\n\nThe flow of energy and materials through the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem. This includes many processes such as biomass production, trophic transfer through plants and animals, nutrient cycling, water dynamics and heat transfer. _TNFD; IPBES_\n\n### Ecosystem health&#x20;\n\nUsed to describe the condition of an ecosystem, by analogy with human health. Note that there is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem. Rather, the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary, depending upon which metrics are employed to assess it and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. _TNFD; IPBES_&#x20;\n\n### Ecosystem Services&#x20;\n\nThe contributions of ecosystems to the benefits that are used in economic and other human activity. _SEEA; TNFD_&#x20;\n\n### Ecosystem Services Value (ESV)&#x20;\n\nESV represents the assessed worth, whether in monetary or non-monetary terms, assigned to the advantages supplied by ecosystems to human well-being and the environment. ESV encompasses an array of services delivered by ecosystems, including clean water provision, pollination, climate regulation, and cultural or recreational experiences. [RealValue](broken-reference) is based on ESV's.\n\n### Ecosystem Type&#x20;\n\nEcosystem type refers to a specific category or classification of ecosystems based on common ecological characteristics, such as vegetation, climate, and predominant species composition. These classifications help scientists, conservationists, and policymakers understand and describe different types of ecosystems, their functions, and their role in the environment. Ecosystem types may include forests, grasslands, wetlands, deserts, and aquatic ecosystems, among others. Categorizing ecosystems into types aids in the study, management, and conservation of natural environments by providing a framework for analysis and decision-making.&#x20;\n\n### Ecotone\n\nEcotones are places where ecosystems grade into each other along a gradient in one or more resources or environmental controls. A typical example is the transition from forest to grassland on a gradient of moisture availability. The precise location of ecosystem types, and hence the ecotones between them is ultimately subjective. Where these gradients are very gentle, ecotones can occupy quite extensive areas. The translation of gradients and ecotones on ecosystem classification will depend on the nature and \u2018sharpness\u2019 of the transition, and the scale of application. _SEEA EA_\n\n### Endangered Species&#x20;\n\nSpecies considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. _IUCN; TNFD_&#x20;\n\n### Environmental Accounting&#x20;\n\nEnvironmental accounting is a specialized field that integrates environmental data and indicators into economic accounting frameworks. It systematically measures and quantifies the interactions between the environment and the economy. Environmental accounting assesses the value of natural resources, monitors environmental assets, analyzes the environmental impacts of economic activities, and informs sustainable development and resource management decisions.&#x20;\n\n### Environmental Asset&#x20;\n\nThe naturally occurring living and non-living components of the Earth, together constituting the biophysical environment, which may provide benefits to humanity. _SEEA; TNFD_&#x20;\n\n### **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**\n\nA core component of the Ethereum blockchain, the EVM is a decentralized virtual computing engine enabling the execution of smart contracts. It allows for applications to run exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship, fraud, or external interference, in a secure and isolated environment. Smart contracts, written in high-level programming languages, are compiled into bytecode executed by the EVM across the decentralized Ethereum network, ensuring integrity and security of operations.\n\n### ERC-1155&#x20;\n\nERC-1155 is a remarkably versatile Ethereum token standard that revolutionizes the world of digital assets by combining the features of both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs), within a single smart contract. This innovative standard, introduced as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), empowers developers to craft a diverse range of tokens, including unique, one-of-a-kind items (NFTs), tokens with partial fungibility (SFTs), and fully interchangeable tokens (FTs), all coexisting harmoniously within a unified smart contract. In practical terms, ERC-1155 offers unparalleled adaptability and efficiency, making it exceptionally well-suited for applications and games where users engage with a wide array of assets. Some of these assets possess individual uniqueness and value (NFTs), some exhibit partial fungibility for specific use cases (SFTs), while others can be readily exchanged like traditional currencies (FTs). By consolidating these token types into a single smart contract, ERC-1155 streamlines operations, reduces gas consumption, and enhances the overall performance of decentralized applications. This groundbreaking standard has gained widespread acclaim in blockchain-based gaming, digital collectibles platforms, and beyond. ERC-1155 fundamentally transforms the landscape of digital asset management on the Ethereum blockchain, fostering the creation of intricate, dynamic token ecosystems that cater to a multitude of use cases within the burgeoning NFT ecosystem.\n\n### ERC-721&#x20;\n\nERC-721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership or proof of authenticity of specific items or digital content, such as digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and interchangeable, each ERC-721 token is distinct and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with other tokens. ERC-721 tokens have gained widespread use in blockchain-based applications and platforms that require secure and transparent management of ownership and provenance for digital or physical assets. They have fueled the growth of the NFT market, enabling the creation, trade, and ownership verification of a diverse array of unique digital assets.&#x20;\n\n### ESRI&#x20;\n\nESRI, or the Environmental Systems Research Institute, is a prominent global provider of geographic information system (GIS) software, tools, and solutions. ESRI's GIS technology is widely used in various industries, including environmental management, urban planning, natural resource conservation, and more. Their software, such as ArcGIS, enables organizations to capture, analyze, and visualize spatial data to make informed decisions and solve complex spatial problems. ESRI plays a crucial role in advancing the use of geospatial technology for understanding and addressing environmental and geographical challenges.&#x20;\n\n### ESVD&#x20;\n\nThe ESVD, short for Ecosystem Services Valuation Database, is a resource that compiles information related to the valuation of ecosystem services. It encompasses over 4,000 studies and data sources that quantify the economic and non-economic values provided by ecosystems, helping researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders better understand and assess the importance of these services for decision-making and sustainable resource management.&#x20;\n\n### Ethereum&#x20;\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses Ether (ETH) as its native cryptocurrency. Ethereum's programmable environment enables the creation of trustless, automated agreements (smart contracts) and various decentralized applications. It's a fundamental technology in DeFi, NFTs, and the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\n### Externalities&#x20;\n\nExternalities are a key concept in economics and refer to the unintended effects of economic activities that spill over to impact individuals or groups who were not directly involved in those activities. These effects can be either positive or negative. Negative externalities, such as environmental pollution or noise disturbances from industrial operations, impose costs on society, often without the responsible parties fully accounting for them. Conversely, positive externalities, like education or healthcare, can provide benefits to society beyond those directly participating. Externalities can lead to market inefficiencies, as they are not reflected in the prices of goods or services, prompting the need for government intervention through regulation, taxation, or incentives to correct these market failures and promote more equitable and sustainable outcomes for both individuals and the broader community.\n\n## F\n\n## G\n\n### **GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)**\n\nDeveloped jointly by MSCI and Standard & Poor's, GICS is a comprehensive industry classification system that categorizes companies into sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries. It is widely used in the financial sector for portfolio management, research, and market analysis.\n\n## H\n\n### Half Earth\n\nThe \"Half Earth\" concept, proposed by biologist E.O. Wilson, suggests that to safeguard Earth's biodiversity and ecological health, we should set aside and protect at least half of the planet's terrestrial and marine ecosystems for conservation purposes. The idea is to designate these areas as protected reserves, free from significant human interference, to preserve a wide range of species and their habitats. By dedicating 50% of the Earth's land and oceans to conservation, the \"Half Earth\" concept aims to mitigate the ongoing loss of biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and ensure the long-term survival of countless species. This ambitious goal underscores the importance of prioritizing conservation efforts and adopting sustainable practices to address the interconnected challenges of biodiversity loss and habitat degradation.\n\n## I\n\n### **ICB**\n\nsee [ICB](ecosystem-services-dependencies-and-risks/industry-classifications.md#icb-industry-classification-benchmark)\n\n### **ISIC 4**\n\nsee [ISIC 4](ecosystem-services-dependencies-and-risks/industry-classifications.md#isic-4-international-standard-industrial-classification-of-all-economic-activities-revision-4)\n\n### Instrumental Value\n\nassociated with an entity that serves to achieve a human end, interest or preference.

In 2009, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for her pioneering research in this field. Ostrom's work challenged the traditional view that common-pool resources are prone to overuse and depletion, demonstrating that communities can effectively manage shared resources through self-governance and cooperation. Her research highlighted the importance of local knowledge, well-defined rules, and social institutions in achieving sustainable resource management. Elinor Ostrom's work has had a profound impact on the fields of environmental economics, resource management, and sustainable development.\n\n## P\n\n## Q\n\n## R\n\n### **Relational Value**\n\nthe meaningfulness of relationships, including the relationships among humans and nature and among humans, including across generations, via nature (Chan et al., 2016). These values are attached to the entity itself in ways that make it not substitutable, hence not serving an instrumental or utilitarian perspective (O\u2019Neill, 2017), and represent what people consider meaningful about nature (e.g., attachment, responsibility, commitment). Relational values can also be associated with relationships with nature towards achieving a good life, e.g., when choosing \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d or in the context of a \u201cmeaningful life.\u201d (Pascual et al., 2017). _IPBES (2019), Global assessment report of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, Brond\u00edzio, E.

The Transitional waters biome includes coastal inlets that are influenced by inputs of both fresh and marine water from terrestrial catchments and ocean tides, waves and currents. They include deep-water coastal inlets or fjords mostly restricted to high latitudes, as well as estuaries, bays and lagoons, which are scattered around coastlines throughout the world. Gradients in water regimes, water chemistry, depth, temperature, size and salinity influence the function, productivity, diversity and trophic structure of these transitional ecosystems. The balance between marine or freshwater influences varies seasonally and inter-annually, depending on the climate and among inlets with differing geomorphology, catchment size, climate and exposure to waves and currents. In some cases, ecosystems characteristic of the marine shelf biome (i.e. M1.1 Seagrass meadows) may have significant occurrences within semi-confined transitional waters. Some inlets are permanently connected to the ocean, but others are only intermittently connected, influencing exchanges of water, nutrients and biota among ecosystems. The dynamics of connection and closure of shallow inlets are regulated by variations in steam flow inputs and wave activity. Strong horizontal and vertical salinity gradients (varying with freshwater and marine inputs) structure biotic communities and traits that equip species for occupying different salinity niches. Autochthonous energy generated by primary production from aquatic macrophytes, phytoplankton, macroalgae and diatoms is subsidised by allochthonous inputs from inlet shorelines, freshwater streams and marine incursion. These high levels of energy availability support complex trophic networks, including large populations of macroinvertebrates, fish, waterbirds, seabirds and some mammals and reptiles. Many inlets function as fish nurseries and bird breeding sites.\n\n### Shoreline systems\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Rocky shores, Muddy shores, Sandy shores, Boulder and cobble shores. The Shoreline systems biome comprises naturally formed, intertidal abiogenic habitats situated at the interface between land and sea. The distribution of the biome spans all latitudes (temperate to polar) at which landmasses are present. Productivity ranges from high to low, is loosely proportional to the availability of stable hard substrate for macrophyte attachment and inversely proportional to the dependency on allochthonous energy sources derived from both land and sea. Productivity is also influenced by coastal upwelling and, for ecotypes of finer particle size, the nutrient content of adjacent terrestrial sediments. Within and across ecotypes, biotic communities are strongly structured by tides, waves and particle size, ranging from contiguous rock to fine silts and clays. Notably, some shorelines comprise mixed hard and soft substrates, with vertical zonation varying temporally in response to storm events and redeposition of soft sediments. Tides produce a vertical gradient of increasing aerial exposure across which desiccation and temperature stress increase, time available for filter-feeding decreases, and interactions with marine and terrestrial predators vary. Waves and particle size determine substrate stability and the physical disturbance regime. Wave action, diminishing from headlands to bays, produces horizontal gradients in community structure. Many organisms possess morphological and behavioural adaptations to prevent desiccation at low tide and dislodgement by wave forces. Burrowing animals are important in unconsolidated sediments. Competition (especially for space) is a major factor structuring communities, with its importance diminishing with decreasing particle size. Facilitative interactions (particularly those that protect organisms from desiccation stress or physical disturbance) can be important across ecosystems of all particle sizes. Biodiversity is generally high, with microscopic lifeforms dominating the biomass of systems of small particle size.\n\n### Supralittoral coastal systems\n\nbiome is comprised of the Ecosystem Functional Group (EFG): Coastal shrublands and grasslands. The Supralittoral coastal biome marks the landward extent of the transition from marine to terrestrial biomes. It is elevated above the direct influence of waves and tides (see MT1) and beyond the direct influence of freshwater seepage or rivers (see MFT1). Supratidal coastal ecosystems extend around all the world\u2019s land masses, occupying a fringe from tens of metres to a few kilometres wide and covering the entire extent of many small islands. Onshore winds, created by differences in air pressure related to the differing heat capacities of water and dry land, are a key driver of ecosystem function. These winds create desiccating conditions on elevated landforms, such as headlands and coastal dunes, as well as continual inputs of aerosol salts and salt spray. Even though the supralittoral zone is located above high spring tide, it is exposed to recurring disturbance from storms producing exceptional waves and tides that reduce standing biomass and destabilise substrates. These strong environmental gradients select for a specialised, low-diversity biota. Much of this biota is confined to supralittoral ecosystems and nowhere else, a key feature of these ecosystems, although it may be widely distributed behind shorelines on different land masses due to dispersal by coastal winds, oceanic currents, and/or migratory behaviour. Autochthonous energy is produced by wind-pruned vegetation with traits promoting tolerance to desiccation, high salinity and substrate instability (e.g. stomatal regulation, extensive rhizomes or root systems and succulence). The sea supplies allochthonous energy subsidies, such as wrack and guano, but also transports a portion of primary production to other ecosystems. Invertebrate detritivores and physical weathering contribute to rapid decay. Supralittoral ecosystems also provide nesting habitat for seabirds on the surface, in vegetation or in burrows, especially on islands free from terrestrial mammalian predators.\n\n### Brackish tidal systems\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Coastal river deltas, Intertidal forests and shrublands (i.e. mangroves), Coastal saltmarshes and reedbeds. The Brackish tidal systems biome is associated with prograding depositional shorelines at the interface of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. The relative influences of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial processes vary from strongly fluvial deltas to marine-dominated intertidal forests and terrestrial-dominated coastal saltmarsh. Autochthonous sources of energy, contributed by flowering plants and algae, are supplemented by allochthonous sources delivered by rivers, currents, and tides. These sources support high productivity and complex trophic webs that include highly mobile fish and birds that rely on brackish tidal systems to complete their lifecycles. Standing plants assimilate energy and engineer habitat structure for epifauna and epiflora as well as juvenile fish nurseries. They also promote sediment deposition by dampening wave and tidal energy. While terrestrial systems are the ultimate source of most sediment, fluvial and marine processes redistribute it and drive patch dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. Brackish tidal systems are structured by steep local gradients in salinity and tidal exposure. Physiological traits that confer differential fitness and competitive abilities, together with differential predation pressure, mediate species turnover along gradients. Brackish tidal systems are distributed on depositional coastlines throughout the world.\n\n### Marine Shelfs\n\nbiome is comprised of these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Seagrass meadows, Kelp forests, Photic coral reefs, Shellfish beds and reefs, Photo-limited marine animal forests, Subtidal rocky reefs, Subtidal sand beds, Subtidal mud plains, Upwelling zones. The Marine shelf biome is distributed globally between the shoreline and deep sea-floor biomes and is dominated by benthic productivity. It includes ecosystems with biogenic substrates (such as seagrass meadows, kelp forests, oyster beds and coral reefs) and minerogenic substrates, including rocky reefs, sandy bottoms and muddy bottoms. The availability of light and nutrients are key structuring factors, influencing productivity and ecosystem structure and function. Turbidity and depth gradients influence light availability. Productivity depends on upwelling currents that deliver nutrients from the deep ocean floor, as well as the strength of nutrient inputs from the land, delivered largely by fluvial systems. Light is influenced by depth gradients, but also by water clarity (cf. turbidity), and determines whether macrophytes and animals dependent on photosynthetic symbionts are able to establish and persist. Additionally, whether the bottom type is hard or soft dictates whether sessile organisms can dominate, forming biogenic habitats that protrude into the water column. A shallow water biome, the marine shelf is shaped by kinetic wave energy and, in polar regions, also ice scour. Positive feedback loops, whereby the habitat structures formed by sessile organisms dampens kinetic energy, can enable ecotypes to persist under marginally suitable conditions. The strength of top-down control by consumers can be an important factor in determining community structure. Depending on the benthic biota, energy sources can vary from net autotrophic to net heterotrophic. Temperature and, to a lesser extent, salinity influence the presence and identity of dominant habitat-forming biota. Currents can influence ecotypes by determining patterns of larval dispersal and the flow of resources.\n\n### Anthropogenic shorelines\n\nbiome is comprised of the Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Artificial shores. The Anthropogenic shorelines biome is distributed globally where urbanised and industrial areas adjoin the coast, and includes some more remote structures such as artificial islands. It includes marine interfaces constructed from hard, smooth surfaces, including concrete, timber, lithic blocks and earthen fill, adjoining, extending or replacing natural shores, or floating in proximity to them. These relatively homogeneous substrates support an opportunistic, cosmopolitan biota with limited diversity and simplified trophic structure compared to other shoreline systems. Vertical surfaces are inhabited by algae and biofouling species but are exposed to strong tidal desiccation regimes that strongly filter potential colonists. Floating structures have downward-facing, usually smooth, surfaces, unlike almost anything in nature, which may be colonised by opportunists. Influx of storm water and effluent enhances nutrient levels and eutrophic algae, which contribute autochthonous energy. Outflows from developed areas are also major sources of allochthonous energy. Strong bottom-up regulation stems from these resource inputs and from low populations of predators, which are depleted or deterred by human activity.\n\n### Anthropogenic marine systems\n\nbiome is comprised of the Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Submerged artificial structures and Marine aquafarms. Humans have constructed, deposited or dumped artificial structures in the oceans that either confine managed marine organisms or attract marine biota that would not otherwise occupy such locations. These structures are distributed globally but are most common in regions of high-density occupation or transit. They include shipwrecks and mineral, gas, or energy infrastructure, pipelines, and rubble piles, as well as aquaculture infrastructure. These installations provide an epibenthic substrate for sessile benthic organisms, as well as a demersal or pelagic environment for mobile organisms. Diversity and biomass of the epibenthic biofouling community is positively related to substrate rugosity. Most energy is supplied to these ecosystems from allochthonous sources, either passively via currents or actively through addition by humans (as is thecase in aquaculture). Epibenthic and planktonic marine algae, however, make a contribution to the energy budget through local primary production. Microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores in the sediments beneath and around the structures feed on particulate organic matter from the epibenthic biota (e.g. waste products and decaying bodies) or on unconsumed food delivered to managed species. The elevated productivity or visual features of artificial structures often attract larger pelagic predators, which forage in the vicinity.\n\n## ESVD\n\nThe **Coastal systems (including wetlands) biome** in ESVD is comprised of Sand dunes, beaches, rocky shores, Tidal marshes, Salt marshes, Mangroves, Lagoons, Estuaries, Unvegetated sediment, Shellfish reefs, Seagrass beds, Kelp forests, Other (coastal systems)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nFEMA has three coastal categories: Coastal wetlands, Beaches and Dunes, Shellfish reefs, and Coral Reefs.\n\n**Coastal wetlands** are defined as: Areas of tidal wetlands (herbaceous and/or woody vegetation) or deepwater habitats in which plants grow and form a continuous cover principally on or at the surface of the water (e.g., algal mats, kelp beds, and submerged aquatic vegetation); AND vegetation coverage is greater than 20%; AND these waters are tidally influenced and have a salinity greater than or equal to 0.5 parts per thousand. This definition of coastal wetland is a combination of several categories within the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Regional Land Cover Classification Scheme for Estuarine Wetlands developed by NOAA, 40 which is a nationally standardized inventory of land cover for the coastal areas of the U.S. Specifically, the following categories have been captured: Estuarine Forested Wetland (16); Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (17); Estuarine Emergent Wetland (18); and Estuarine Aquatic Bed (23).\n\n**Beaches and Dunes** are defined as: Areas consisting of material such as silt, sand, or gravel that is subject to inundation and redistribution due to water or wind. Substrates have no vegetative cover except for pioneering plants that are briefly established when growing conditions are favorable. This definition of beaches and dunes is based on the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Regional Land Cover Classification Scheme definition of Unconsolidated Shore. This is a nationally standardized inventory of land cover for the coastal areas of the U.S. developed by NOAA.\n\n**Shellfish Reefs** are defined as: Areas where the substrate is dominated by living or non-living shell reefs and are surrounded and intermixed with channels and unvegetated flats, typically occurring in the intertidal zone. This definition of shellfish reefs is based on the 2012 Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Coastal and marine ecological classification standard similar to the \u201cClassification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats in the United States\u201d.\n\n**Coral Reefs** are defined as: Areas of hardened, fixed substrate or structures created by deposition of calcium carbonate by reef- building coral species. May include both deep- and shallow-water coral species. This definition of coral reefs is based on the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS),255 a national framework which organizes information about coasts and oceans. CMECS is endorsed by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) as the national standard for classifying coastal and marine areas.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/coastal-systems.md", "sha": "e508ad4e7556e9b39fc3e30037420c310ca690a0", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/coastal-systems.md"}}, {"content": "# Cultivated & Developed\n\n## IUCN GET 2.0\n\nT7 Intensive land-use systems\n\n### **Intensive land-use systems**\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Annual croplands, Sown pastures and fields, Plantations, Urban and industrial ecosystems, Derived semi-natural pastures and oldfields. Intensive land-use systems include major anthropogenic enterprises of cropping, pastoralism, plantation farming, and urbanisation. Human intervention is a dominating influence on this biome, also known as the \u2018anthrome\u2019. Maintenance of these systems is contingent on continuing human interventions, including alterations to the physical structure of vegetation and substrates (e.g. clearing, earthworks and drainage), the supplementation of resources (e.g. with irrigation and fertilisers) and the introduction and control of biota. These interventions maintain disequilibrium community structure and composition, low endemism and low functional and taxonomic diversity. Target biota are genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators and diseases. Non-target biota include widely dispersed, cosmopolitan opportunists with short lifecycles. Many intensive land use systems are maintained as artificial mosaics of contrasting patch types at scales of metres to hundreds of metres. Typically, but not exclusively, they are associated with temperate or subtropical climates and the natural availability of freshwater and nutrients from fertile soils on flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. The antecedent ecosystems that they replaced include forests, shrublands, grasslands and palustrine wetlands (biomes T1\u2212T4 and TF1). On global and regional scales, intensive land- use systems are engaged in climate feedback processes via alterations to the water cycle and the release of greenhouse gases from vegetation, soils, livestock and fossil fuels. On local scales, temperatures may be modified by human-built structures (i.e. heat-island effects) or may be artificially controlled.\n\n## ESVD\n\n### Cultivated Area and Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure biomes\n\n**Cultivated Area biome** is comprised of Cropland (arable land), Pastures, Orchards/agro-forestry, Plantations, Rice paddies, Aquaculture, Small landscape elements, Other (cultivated areas). &#x20;\n\n**Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure biome** is comprised of Urban Parks & Forests, Lawns, sports fields, golf courses, Urban lakes, ponds, wetlands, Street Trees & Shrubs, Other (urban green-blue).\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nNot defined as a land cover / ecosystem type.

The Deserts and semi-deserts biome includes low to very low biomass ecosystems occurring in arid or semi-arid climates, principally associated with the subtropical high-pressure belts and major continental rain shadows. Primary productivity is low or very low and dependent on low densities of low-stature photoautotrophs that sustain a complete but sparse trophic web of consumers and predators. Productivity is limited by severe water deficits caused by very low rainfall. Rainfall deficits are exacerbated by extremes of temperature and desiccating winds. Resources, productivity and biomass are highly variable in space and time in response to the amount of annual rainfall, the size of individual rainfall events, and the lateral movement of resources from sources to sinks. Landscape heterogeneity and resource gradients are therefore critical to the persistence of desert biota in the context of highly stochastic, unseasonal temporal patterns of rainfall events that drive \u2018pulse and reserve\u2019 or \u2018boom-bust\u2019 ecosystem dynamics. There may be high rates of erosion and sedimentation due to the lack of surface stability provided by the sparse vegetation cover and this can be amplified by the activities of large mammals and people. Extreme and prolonged water deficits, punctuated by short episodes of surplus, impose severe physiological constraints on plants and animals, which exhibit a variety of physiological, morphological, behavioural and life-history traits enabling water acquisition and conservation. The life-history spectra of desert systems are polarised between long-lived drought tolerators with low metabolic rates and opportunistic drought evaders with either high mobility or short- lived active phases and long dormant phases. Mobility enables organisms to track transient resources over large distances. Competitive interactions are weak, although herbivory and predation are more evident in the most productive ecosystems and during the decline in resource availability that follows rainfall events.\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Deserts biome** includes True desert (sand/rock/salt), Semi-desert, and Other (desert).\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nNot defined as a land cover / ecosystem type.

The Tropical-subtropical forests biome includes moderate to highly productive ecosystems with closed tree canopies occurring at lower latitudes north and south of the equator. Fragmented occurrences extend to the subtropics in suitable mesoclimates. High primary productivity is underpinned by high insolation, warm temperatures, relatively low seasonal variation in day length and temperature (increasing to the subtropics), and strong water surpluses associated with the intertropical convergence zone extending to wetter parts of the seasonal tropics and subtropics. Productivity and biomass vary in response to: i) strong rainfall gradients associated with seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone; ii) altitudinal gradients in precipitation, cloud cover, and temperatures; and iii) edaphic gradients that influence the availability of soil nutrients. Species diversity and the complexity of both vegetation and trophic structures are positively correlated with standing biomass and primary productivity; however, trophic webs and other ecosystem processes are strongly regulated from the bottom-up by the dominant photoautotrophs (trees), which fix abundant energy and carbon, engineer habitats for many other organisms, and underpin feedbacks related to nutrient and water cycling and regional climate. Complex nutrient cycling and/or sequestering mechanisms are common, countering the high potential for soil nutrient leaching due to high rainfall. Plant species exhibit leaf plasticity, shade tolerance and gap-phase dynamics in response to the periodic opening of canopy gaps initiated by tree death, storm damage, and lightning strikes. Fires may occur in ecotonal areas between these forests and savannas. Biogeographic legacies result in strong compositional distinctions and consequently some functional differences among land masses within the biome.\n\n### Temperate-boreal forests & woodlands\n\nbiome is comprised of these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Boreal and temperate high montane forests and woodlands, Deciduous temperate forests, Oceanic cool temperate rainforests, Warm temperate laurophyll forests, Temperate pyric humid forests, Temperate pyric sclerophyll forests and woodlands. Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands biome include moderate to highly productive tree-dominated systems with a wide range of physiognomic and structural expressions distributed from warm-temperate to boreal latitudes. Although generally less diverse than Tropical-subtropical forests (T1) in taxa such as flowering plants, primates, and birds, these Temperate-boreal forests exhibit greater temporal and spatial variability in productivity, biomass, phenology, and leaf traits of trees. Temporal variability is expressed primarily through seasonal variation in water balance and/or temperature, which regulate the length and timing of growing and breeding seasons. Inter-annual variation is usually less important than in some other biomes (i.e. T5), but nonetheless may play significant roles in resource availability and disturbance regimes (e.g. fire and storms). Gradients in minimum temperatures, soil nutrients, and fire regimes differentiate ecosystem functional groups within this biome. These influence traits such as leaf form (broadleaf vs. needleleaf), leaf phenology (evergreen vs. deciduous), ecophysiological and morphological traits promoting nutrient acquisition and conservation, and morphological traits related to flammability, fire resistance, and recovery. The dominant photoautotrophs (trees) engineer habitats and underpin trophic webs. Resource gradients exert strong bottom-up controls on trophic processes, but in some temperate forests, fires are significant top-down consumers of biomass, as well as influencing flammability feedbacks and timing of life-history processes, such as reproduction and recruitment.\n\n## ESVD\n\nESVD and TEEB separate forests into tropical and temperate: &#x20;\n\n**Tropical forests** include Tropical rain forest, Tropical dry forest, Tropical cloud forests, Other (tropical forests)\n\n**Temperate forests** include Temperate rain or evergreen forest, Temperate deciduous forest, Boreal/coniferous forest (\u2018Taiga\u2019), Other (temperate forests)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\n**Forests**: Areas dominated by trees (evergreen and/or deciduous) generally greater than 5 meters tall that \u2013 on average \u2013 comprise greater than 20% of the total vegetation cover within the area or unit of analysis (e.g., pixel, polygon, parcel).\n\n_FEMA Ecosystem Service Value Updates 2022 uses the 2019 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) as modified from the Anderson Land Cover Classification System._\n\n## Other\n\nIUCN Red List, USGS, ESRI, and Dynamic World uses Forest or Trees and do not sub-categorize.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/forests.md", "sha": "981066411a629792aa125dc91b743b7dae99b398", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/forests.md"}}, {"content": "# Grasslands\n\n## IUCN GET 2.0\n\nT4 Savannas and grasslands\n\nThe **savannas and grasslands biome** is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Trophic savannas, Pyric tussock savannas, Hummock savannas, Temperate woodlands, Temperate subhumid grasslands. Ecological functions within the Savannas and grasslands biome are closely linked to a mostly continuous ground layer of grasses that contribute moderate to very high levels of primary productivity driven by strongly seasonal water surplus and deficit cycles. The timing of the seasonal cycle of productivity varies with latitude and becomes more variable inter-annually as total rainfall declines. The woody component of the vegetation may be completely absent or may vary to a height and stature that resembles that of a forest. In the tropics and subtropics, productivity peaks in the summer when high rainfall coincides with warm temperatures. At temperate latitudes, summer growth is suppressed by water deficits associated with high evapotranspiration, sometimes exacerbated by weakly seasonal (winter-maximum) rainfall, so that productivity peaks in spring when warming temperatures coincide with high soil moisture accumulated over winter. Co-existence between trees and grasses and between grasses and interstitial forbs is mediated by herbivory and/or fire. These agents are critical in the top- down regulation of grassy ecosystems and in some cases are involved in feedback mechanisms that mediate regime shifts between alternative stable states. Herbivory is the primary driver in highly fertile and productive systems, whereas fire is the primary driver in less fertile and lower productivity systems. Nutrient gradients are exacerbated volatilisation during fire and the loss of nutrients in smoke. The representation of grass species with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways varies with water availability and temperature over regional and continental climatic gradients. Grasses are rapid responders to seasonal pulses of elevated soil moisture and sustain a complex trophic web with large-bodied mammalian herbivores and their predators. The curing of grasses over the dry season is critical to flammability. Mammal diversity, trophic complexity, and the expression of physical and chemical defences against herbivory also vary with soil fertility.\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Grassland/Rangeland biome** comprised of Savanna, Tropical grasslands, Temperate grasslands, Steppe (dry, cold grassland), Other (grassland)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nNot defined as a land cover / ecosystem type.

At the interface of terrestrial and freshwater realms, the Palustrine wetlands biome includes vegetated floodplains, groundwater seeps, and mires with permanent or intermittent surface water. Although water and light are abundant at least periodically, saturation of the soil may result in oxygen deprivation below the ground. This suppresses microbial activity and, in many systems, production exceeds decomposition, resulting in peat accumulation. The water regime influences resource availability and productivity and thus regulates these ecosystems from the bottom-up. Interactions among catchment precipitation, local evapotranspiration, and substrate and surface morphology regulate run-on, runoff, infiltration, and percolation. This results in water regimes that vary from permanent shallow standing water or near-surface water tables to seasonally high water tables to episodic inundation with long inter-annual dry phases. As a consequence of their indirect relationships with climate, wetland biomes are traditionally classified as \u2018azonal\u2019. Spatial heterogeneity is a key feature of palustrine wetlands. At landscape scales, they function as resource sinks and refuges with substantially higher productivity than the surrounding matrix. Fine-scale spatial variation in the water regime often produces restricted hydrological niches and intricate mosaics of patch types with contrasting structure and biotic composition. Autotrophs dominate complex trophic webs. Amphibious macrophytes are the dominant autotrophs, although epibenthic algae are important in some systems. Amphibious plants have specialised traits enabling growth and survival in low-oxygen substrates and often engineer habitats for heterotrophs. Microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores are most abundant in surface soils. A range of microscopic and macroinvertebrates with sedentary adult phases (i.e. crustaceans) have obligate associations with Palustrine wetlands, which also provide important foraging and breeding sites for macroinvertebrate and vertebrate herbivores and predators that disperse more widely across the landscape, including waterbirds.\n\n### Artificial wetlands\n\nbiome consist of these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Large reservoirs, Constructed lacustrine wetlands, Rice paddies, Freshwater aquafarms, Canals, ditches and drains. The Artificial wetlands biome includes built structures that hold or transfer water for human use, treatment, or disposal, including large storage reservoirs, farm dams or ponds, recreational and ornamental wetlands, rice paddies, freshwater aquafarms, wastewater storages and treatment ponds, and canals, ditches and drains. These are globally distributed but are most often found in humid and subhumid tropical and temperate environments where rural and urban developments are predominant. Most of these ecosystems contain standing water with the exception of canals and drains. For most of these ecosystems, energy, water and nutrients come primarily from allochthonous sources, either incidentally from runoff (e.g. farm dams, ditches and storm water canals) or groundwater, or deterministically by management (e.g. rice paddies, aquafarms, and wastewater ponds), but autochthonous energy sources (in situ algae and macrophytes) can be important in some artificial waterbodies. Water chemistry varies with human use, with some wastewater ponds accumulating toxins or eutrophic levels of nutrients, while large reservoirs with undisturbed catchments may be oligotrophic. Artificial wetlands are generally less temporally variable, more spatially homogeneous, and often support less biological diversity and trophic complexity of their natural analogues. Nonetheless, in some highly transformed landscapes, they may provide anthropogenic refuges and critical habitat for complementary suites of native biota to that remaining in depleted wetlands, including some biota that no longer occur in natural or semi-natural ecosystems, as well as a range of opportunistic colonists. Trophic webs vary with the connectivity and depth of the water body, temperature and substrate. The simplest artificial wetlands support only microbial biota, while the most diverse can include submerged or emergent plant communities, which promote complex habitats for invertebrates, fish, waterbirds, amphibians, reptiles and, sometimes, amphibious mammals.\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Inland wetlands** include: Swamps, marshes; Peatland, Non-forested; Peatland, Forested; Peatland, Tropical; Peatland, Boreal; Wetlands, Forested (on alluvial soils); Wetlands, Groundwater-dependent; Floodplains; Other (inland wetlands)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\n**Inland Wetlands**: Areas dominated (20 percent or more) by perennial herbaceous vegetation, vegetation that grows and forms a continuous cover on or at the surface of the water, shrubland vegetation, or forest; AND the soil or substrate is at least periodically saturated with or covered with water; AND these waters are tidally influenced and have a salinity less than 0.5 parts per thousand.\n\n_This definition is based on the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Regional Land Cover Classification Scheme definitions for Palustrine wetlands and aquatic beds._\n\n## Other\n\nUSGS does have a Wetlands category while ESRI and Dynamic World use Water and Flooded Vegetation.\n\n### USGS (NLCD) Wetlands: &#x20;\n\n**Woody Wetlands** - areas where forest or shrubland vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water.&#x20;\n\n**Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands** - Areas where perennial herbaceous vegetation accounts for greater than 80% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water.&#x20;\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/inland-wetlands.md", "sha": "48c8c7c5446d628eaeb95e9198cacc168c1ee723", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/inland-wetlands.md"}}, {"content": "# Polar & Alpine\n\n## IUCN GET 2.0\n\nT6 Polar-alpine\n\n**Polar-alpine biome** is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Ice sheets, glaciers and perennial snowfields, Polar-alpine rocky outcrops, Polar tundra and deserts, Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands, Tropical alpine grasslands and shrublands. The Polar-alpine biome encompasses the extensive Arctic and Antarctic regions as well as high mountainous areas across all continental land masses. Primary productivity is low or very low, strictly seasonal and limited by conditions of extreme cold associated with low insolation and/or high elevation, further exacerbated by desiccating conditions and high-velocity winds. Low temperatures limit metabolic activity and define the length of growing seasons. Microbial decomposition is slow, leading to peat accumulation in the most productive ecosystems. Regional and local temperature gradients shape ecosystems within the biome. Standing biomass, for example, is low or very low and varies with the severity of cold and insolation. Microbial lifeforms dominate in the coldest systems with perennial snow or ice cover, augmented with crustose lichens, bryophytes, and algae on periodically exposed lithic substrates. Forbs, grasses and dwarf shrubs with slow growth rates and long lifespans become increasingly prominent and may develop continuous cover with increasing insolation and warmer conditions. This vegetation cover provides habitat structure and food for vertebrate and invertebrate consumers and their predators. Trophic webs are simple or truncated and populations of larger vertebrates are generally migratory or itinerant. In these warmer cryogenic systems, snow cover is seasonal (except at equatorial latitudes) and insulates plants and animals that lie dormant beneath it during winter and during their emergence from dormancy prior to spring thaw. While dormancy is a common trait, a diverse range of other physiological, behavioural, and morphological traits that facilitate cold tolerance are also well represented among the biota.\n\n## ESVD\n\nTundra and High mountain & Polar Systems biomes.\n\n**Tundra biome** is comprised of Alpine Tundra, Arctic Tundra, and Other (tundra).\n\n**High mountain & Polar Systems biome** comprised of High Mountain - forest, High Mountain - grassland, High Mountain - snow and ice, Polar, Other (high mountains and polar)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nNot defined as a land cover / ecosystem type.\n\n## Other\n\n### ESRI Land Cover: \u201cSnow/Ice\u201d and \u201cBare Ground\u201d\n\n**Snow/Ice**: Large homogenous areas of permanent snow or ice, typically only in mountain areas or highest latitudes; examples: glaciers, permanent snowpack, snow fields.\n\n**Bare Ground**: Areas of rock or soil with very sparse to no vegetation for the entire year; large areas of sand and deserts with no to little vegetation; examples: exposed rock or soil, desert and sand dunes, dry salt flats/pans, dried lake beds, mines.\n\n### USGS NLCD \u201cPerennial Ice/Snow\u201d and \u201cBarren\u201d\n\n**Perennial Ice/Snow** are areas characterized by a perennial cover of ice and/or snow, generally greater than 25% of total cover.&#x20;\n\n**Barren Land (Rock/Sand/Clay)** are areas of bedrock, desert pavement, scarps, talus, slides, volcanic material, glacial debris, sand dunes, strip mines, gravel pits and other accumulations of earthen material.

Rivers and streams include lotic (running water) ecosystems, flowing from elevated uplands or underground springs to deltas, estuaries, and lakes. They are defined primarily by their linear structure, unidirectional flow regimes, and close interaction with the surrounding landscape. Individual rivers drain catchments separated by watersheds. Channels that make up a river system can be classified into stream orders, with 1st order streams having no tributaries, 2nd order streams having 1st order tributaries, 3rd order having 2nd order tributaries and so on. The world\u2019s largest rivers are 10th-12th order. Flow regimes depend on stream order and rainfall patterns in the catchment (except in regulated rivers and spring-fed streams), which vary from year-round to seasonal to episodic. Stream gradients determine flow velocity and turbulence, bank and substrate structure, and habitat variability, but flow variability depends on regional climate and local weather. River systems in arid zones may remain dry for several years. These factors act as selection filters, differentiating lotic ecosystems and their species\u2019 traits amongst flow regimes, and between uplands and lowlands. Productivity tends to increase from uplands to lowlands and is driven both by allochthonous energy sources that contribute coarse organic matter from terrestrial ecosystems in adjacent riparian zones and upper catchments, and by autochthonous energy synthesis by biofilms or phytoplankton. Phytoplankton is important downstream in larger, slower rivers that carry smaller organic particles and more dissolved organic matter. Erosion and depositional processes depend on the gradient and position of a stream reach within a catchment, and are fundamental to downstream passage of nutrients and organic matter and exchange between river ecosystems and surrounding land. Anthropogenic nutrient inputs increase downstream and vary with land use. Rivers with extensive peatlands in their catchments are rich in tannins, which reduce light penetration through the water column, increase acidity, promote microbial activity that thrives on dissolved organic carbon, and thereby reduce oxygen levels, productivity and biotic diversity, although endemism may be high. Streams in cold climates freeze over in winter, imposing seasonal constraints on productivity and the movement of organisms. Much of the biotic diversity resides in or on the stream benthos. Trophic webs are more complex in large rivers due to greater resource availability and niche diversity, and species-catchment area relationships. Invertebrate detritivores consume fragments of organic matter, providing resources for predatory macroinvertebrates and fish, which in turn support larger predatory fish, waterbirds, reptiles, and some mammals. Specialised species-level traits are associated with different flow regimes and life history strategies often align with patterns of resource availability. For example, suspension feeding is common in high flow velocities, cold tolerance and seasonal dormancy occur in freeze-thaw streams, life cycles are geared to autumnal leaf fall in temperate forested catchments, and desiccation tolerance and dormant life stages dominate in episodic rivers.\n\n### Lakes\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): F2.1 Large permanent freshwater lakes, Small permanent freshwater lakes, Seasonal freshwater lakes, Freeze-thaw freshwater lakes, Ephemeral freshwater lakes, Permanent salt and soda lakes, Ephemeral salt lakes, Artesian springs and oases, Geothermal pools and wetlands, Subglacial lakes. The Lakes biome includes lentic ecosystems defined by their still waters. They vary in area, depth, water regime and connectivity to other aquatic systems across a global distribution. Gradients in water regimes, temperature, lake size and salinity (and salt composition) exert critical influences on the function, productivity, diversity and trophic structure of lake ecosystems. Water regimes vary from permanent open waters to seasonal or episodic filling and drying on interannual time scales. Lakes span global climatic gradients, which influence their water regimes through catchment precipitation and evapotranspiration rates, as well as the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles of lake surfaces along latitudinal and altitudinal temperature gradients. The azonal character of the Lakes biome, however, is due to the buffering of climatic influences by groundwater, geomorphology, and substrate. This is most evident in the water regimes of artesian springs, oases and geothermal wetlands, as their water sources are largely independent of climate. Lake and catchment substrates influence nutrient stocks and salinity, but concentrations may vary temporally depending on water regimes and mixing. Deeper and freeze-thaw lakes are often characterised by stratification, producing depth gradients in nutrient and oxygen availability and temperatures. The deepest lakes extend to the aphotic zone. Productivity is determined by allochthonous inputs from the catchments and autochthonous inputs from phytoplankton, periphyton (i.e. biofilms), and submerged, floating and emergent macrophytes. Trophic webs tend to increase in size and complexity with lake size due to increased resource availability and niche diversity, but small shallow lakes have greater diversity than small deep lakes due to habitat heterogeneity and light penetration to the bottm allowing development of benthic macrophytes and associated biota. Salt lakes may have high productivity but simple trophic structures, with high abundances of few species. Invertebrate detritivores consume fragments of organic matter, providing resources for macroinvertebrates, fish, waterbirds, reptiles and mammals. Species traits appear to be strongly influenced by environmental filtering by the water regime (e.g. cold tolerance and seasonal dormancy occurs in freeze-thaw lakes and desiccation tolerance and dormant life stages dominate in ephemeral lakes) and water chemistry (i.e. tolerance to salinity in salt lakes).\n\n### Semi-confined transitional waters\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Deepwater coastal inlets, Permanently open riverine estuaries and bays, Intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons. The Transitional waters biome includes coastal inlets that are influenced by inputs of both fresh and marine water from terrestrial catchments and ocean tides, waves and currents. They include deep-water coastal inlets or fjords mostly restricted to high latitudes, as well as estuaries, bays and lagoons, which are scattered around coastlines throughout the world. Gradients in water regimes, water chemistry, depth, temperature, size and salinity influence the function, productivity, diversity and trophic structure of these transitional ecosystems. The balance between marine or freshwater influences varies seasonally and inter-annually, depending on the climate and among inlets with differing geomorphology, catchment size, climate and exposure to waves and currents. In some cases, ecosystems characteristic of the marine shelf biome (i.e. M1.1 Seagrass meadows) may have significant occurrences within semi-confined transitional waters. Some inlets are permanently connected to the ocean, but others are only intermittently connected, influencing exchanges of water, nutrients and biota among ecosystems. The dynamics of connection and closure of shallow inlets are regulated by variations in steam flow inputs and wave activity. Strong horizontal and vertical salinity gradients (varying with freshwater and marine inputs) structure biotic communities and traits that equip species for occupying different salinity niches. Autochthonous energy generated by primary production from aquatic macrophytes, phytoplankton, macroalgae and diatoms is subsidised by allochthonous inputs from inlet shorelines, freshwater streams and marine incursion. These high levels of energy availability support complex trophic networks, including large populations of macroinvertebrates, fish, waterbirds, seabirds and some mammals and reptiles. Many inlets function as fish nurseries and bird breeding sites.\n\n### Brackish tidal systems\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Coastal river deltas, Intertidal forests and shrublands, Coastal saltmarshes and reedbeds. The Brackish tidal systems biome is associated with prograding depositional shorelines at the interface of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. The relative influences of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial processes vary from strongly fluvial deltas to marine-dominated intertidal forests and terrestrial-dominated coastal saltmarsh. Autochthonous sources of energy, contributed by flowering plants and algae, are supplemented by allochthonous sources delivered by rivers, currents, and tides. These sources support high productivity and complex trophic webs that include highly mobile fish and birds that rely on brackish tidal systems to complete their lifecycles. Standing plants assimilate energy and engineer habitat structure for epifauna and epiflora as well as juvenile fish nurseries. They also promote sediment deposition by dampening wave and tidal energy. While terrestrial systems are the ultimate source of most sediment, fluvial and marine processes redistribute it and drive patch dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. Brackish tidal systems are structured by steep local gradients in salinity and tidal exposure. Physiological traits that confer differential fitness and competitive abilities, together with differential predation pressure, mediate species turnover along gradients. Brackish tidal systems are distributed on depositional coastlines throughout the world.\n\n### Anthropogenic shorelines\n\nbiome is comprised of the Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Artificial shores. The Anthropogenic shorelines biome is distributed globally where urbanised and industrial areas adjoin the coast, and includes some more remote structures such as artificial islands. It includes marine interfaces constructed from hard, smooth surfaces, including concrete, timber, lithic blocks and earthen fill, adjoining, extending or replacing natural shores, or floating in proximity to them. These relatively homogeneous substrates support an opportunistic, cosmopolitan biota with limited diversity and simplified trophic structure compared to other shoreline systems. Vertical surfaces are inhabited by algae and biofouling species but are exposed to strong tidal desiccation regimes that strongly filter potential colonists. Floating structures have downward-facing, usually smooth, surfaces, unlike almost anything in nature, which may be colonised by opportunists. Influx of storm water and effluent enhances nutrient levels and eutrophic algae, which contribute autochthonous energy. Outflows from developed areas are also major sources of allochthonous energy. Strong bottom-up regulation stems from these resource inputs and from low populations of predators, which are depleted or deterred by human activity.\n\n### Shoreline systems\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Rocky shores, Muddy shores, Sandy shores, Boulder and cobble shores. The Shoreline systems biome comprises naturally formed, intertidal abiogenic habitats situated at the interface between land and sea. The distribution of the biome spans all latitudes (temperate to polar) at which landmasses are present. Productivity ranges from high to low, is loosely proportional to the availability of stable hard substrate for macrophyte attachment and inversely proportional to the dependency on allochthonous energy sources derived from both land and sea. Productivity is also influenced by coastal upwelling and, for ecotypes of finer particle size, the nutrient content of adjacent terrestrial sediments. Within and across ecotypes, biotic communities are strongly structured by tides, waves and particle size, ranging from contiguous rock to fine silts and clays. Notably, some shorelines comprise mixed hard and soft substrates, with vertical zonation varying temporally in response to storm events and redeposition of soft sediments. Tides produce a vertical gradient of increasing aerial exposure across which desiccation and temperature stress increase, time available for filter-feeding decreases, and interactions with marine and terrestrial predators vary. Waves and particle size determine substrate stability and the physical disturbance regime. Wave action, diminishing from headlands to bays, produces horizontal gradients in community structure. Many organisms possess morphological and behavioural adaptations to prevent desiccation at low tide and dislodgement by wave forces. Burrowing animals are important in unconsolidated sediments. Competition (especially for space) is a major factor structuring communities, with its importance diminishing with decreasing particle size. Facilitative interactions (particularly those that protect organisms from desiccation stress or physical disturbance) can be important across ecosystems of all particle sizes. Biodiversity is generally high, with microscopic lifeforms dominating the biomass of systems of small particle size.\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Rivers and lakes biome** is comprised of: rivers; Lakes, freshwater; Lakes, saltwater; Human made water bodies; Other (rivers and lakes)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nFEMA uses two definitions under the title \u201cRiparian\u201d:\n\n### **U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service**\n\nAreas where plant communities are contiguous to and affected by surface and subsurface hydrologic features of perennial or intermittent lotic and lentic water bodies (rivers, streams, lakes, or drainage ways).

Intensive land-use systems include major anthropogenic enterprises of cropping, pastoralism, plantation farming, and urbanisation. Human intervention is a dominating influence on this biome, also known as the \u2018anthrome\u2019. Maintenance of these systems is contingent on continuing human interventions, including alterations to the physical structure of vegetation and substrates (e.g. clearing, earthworks and drainage), the supplementation of resources (e.g. with irrigation and fertilisers) and the introduction and control of biota. These interventions maintain disequilibrium community structure and composition, low endemism and low functional and taxonomic diversity. Target biota are genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators and diseases. Non-target biota include widely dispersed, cosmopolitan opportunists with short lifecycles. Many intensive land use systems are maintained as artificial mosaics of contrasting patch types at scales of metres to hundreds of metres. Typically, but not exclusively, they are associated with temperate or subtropical climates and the natural availability of freshwater and nutrients from fertile soils on flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. The antecedent ecosystems that they replaced include forests, shrublands, grasslands and palustrine wetlands (biomes T1\u2212T4 and TF1). On global and regional scales, intensive land- use systems are engaged in climate feedback processes via alterations to the water cycle and the release of greenhouse gases from vegetation, soils, livestock and fossil fuels. On local scales, temperatures may be modified by human-built structures (i.e. heat-island effects) or may be artificially controlled.\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Cultivated Area and/or Inland Un- or Sparsely Vegetated biome** classification (in a rural setting).\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nUtilizes 2019 National Land CoverDatabase (NLCD):\n\n**Rural green open space areas** where vegetation accounts for at least 80% of total cover (impervious surfaces account for less than 20% of total cover) and have a mixture of some constructed materials located in a rural setting.

Classically regarded as \u2018azonal\u2019 biomes or \u2018pedobiomes\u2019 (i.e. biomes determined by soils), they are scattered across all landmasses outside the polar regions, generally (but not always) closer to continental margins than to interior regions and absent from central Asia. Productivity and biomass are low to moderate and limited by soil fertility. The effect of nutrient poverty on productivity is exacerbated in tropical to mid-latitudes by water deficits occurring during either winter (tropics) or summer (temperate humid and Mediterranean climates) and by low insolation and cold temperatures at higher latitudes. Trophic networks are simple but the major functional components (photoautotrophic plants, decomposers, detritivores, herbivores and predators) are all represented and fuelled by autochthonous energy sources. Shrubs are the dominant primary producers and possess a diversity of leaf and root traits as well as mutualistic relationships with soil microbes that promote the capture and conservation of nutrients. Recurrent disturbance events exert top-down regulation by consuming biomass, releasing resources, and triggering life-history processes (including recruitment and dispersal) in a range of organisms. Fire is the most widespread mechanism, with storms or mass movement of substrate less frequently implicated. Storage effects related to re-sprouting organs and seed banks appear to be important for maintaining plant diversity and hence structure and function in shrublands exposed to recurring fires and water deficits.\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Woodland & Shrubland biome** comprised of Tropical wood-& shrublands, Mediterranean wood-& shrubland, Temperate wood-& shrubland, Heathland, Other (woodland and shrubland)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nNot defined as a land cover / ecosystem type.

The subterranean lithic biome includes non-aquatic lithic systems beneath the earth\u2019s surface. Sunlight is absent or of insufficient intensity to sustain photosynthesis. There is no standing water and moisture is supplied primarily by seepage through the substrate and may be lost by slow diffusion through the atmosphere to cave openings or by vertical or lateral seepage through the substrate. These physically stable systems exhibit low levels of environmental variability. Rarely, mass movements, for example rock falls, may re-organise the physical structure of subterranean ecosystems. Subterranean ecosystems have truncated trophic structures with no photoautotrophs and few obligate predators. Heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates dominate the biota, while chemoautotrophs are the primary energy assimilators. Most have low metabolic rates and prolonged life histories in response to resource limitations, resulting in low overall productivity. The subterranean biome includes dry caves and endolithic systems distributed throughout the earth\u2019s crust. Incursions of fresh or marine waters generate transitional biomes (SF, SM).\n\n### Anthropogenic subterranean voids\n\nbiome is comprised one Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Anthropogenic subterranean voids.  The Anthropogenic subterranean voids biome includes asingle functional group of ecosystems that owe their genesis to excavation by humans. They include underground mines, transport tunnels, tombs, defence and energy installations, and other infrastructure. Most are very recent ecosystems constructed with earth-moving machinery during the industrial era, but some were constructed manually up to several millennia ago. Productivity is low and energy generally comes from allochthonous sources via connections to the surface, either by atmospheric diffusion or seepage, but some energy is contributed by chemoautotrophic microbes. While sunlight is absent or highly diffuse, some active voids are artificially lit and this may provide sufficient energy to sustain algal autotrophs. Trophic webs are simple and dominated by opportunistic microbes and invertebrates introduced by machinery or directly by humans, or else colonising spontaneously through openings to the surface. The latter may include small mammals that use the voids as refuges or breeding sites. Microbes from external and endolithic sources rapidly colonise newly exposed lithic surfaces and create biofilms that support detritivores and enhance substrate weathering. The stability of artificial subterranean voids varies depending on their substrate and management, with some prone to collapse and structural change after active use ceases.\n\n### Subterranean freshwaters\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Underground streams and pools and Groundwater ecosystems. The Subterranean freshwaters biome includes streams, small lakes and aquifers beneath the earth\u2019s surface and potentially has the largest volume of water of all the freshwater biomes. In the absence of sunlight, these ecosystems rely on allochthonous energy sourced from surface ecosystems via connected waters and in situ chemoautotrophs. Depending on the mode of connectivity to the surface, water flow- through varies from extremely rapid to slow. Highly connected subterranean streams in monsoonal climates undergo seasonal flooding and drying cycles. In contrast, paleo- aquifers are characterised by slow, low-variability seepage over millennial time scales. Inflowing water is the principal source of dissolved oxygen and mineral nutrients, although some nutrients are liberated by in situ weathering of lithic substrates. The water regime largely determines environmental variability in subterranean freshwaters, but these systems may occasionally be influenced by mass movements. The trophic structure of subterranean waters is typically truncated, although photosynthetically inactive, algae and higher-plant propagules may be transient occupants in systems that are connected to the surface. Chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic microbes in biofilms and the water column dominate the trophic web, supporting small invertebrate detritivores and predators. Small predatory fish may occur in streams and lakes, where voids in the subsurface are of sufficient size. Productivity, metabolic rates, life histories and the diversity of the biota all reflect resource scarcity but may vary depending on water source. Insular systems exhibit high levels of endemism.\n\n### Anthropogenic subterranean freshwater\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Water pipes and subterranean canals, Flooded mines and other voids. The Artificial subterranean freshwaters biome includes aquatic systems in underground canals, drains, sewers, water pipes and flooded mines constructed by humans. These are usually well connected to surface waters. The availability of resources is largely a function of source waters and the water regime, which varies from permanent to intermittent with low to high flow velocity or, in the case of flooded mines, negligible flow. Sunlight is absent or, if it diffuses through vents and portals (as in some canals), it is generally too dim to support photosynthesis. Algae may nonetheless be transported through these systems depending on the water of source. Although primary productivity is low and energy is supplied from allochthonous sources, secondary productivity by heterotrophic microbes in biofilms and in the water column may be high in sewers and drains where organic Carbon, nutrients and dissolved oxygen are abundant. This may support several tiers of detritivores and predators, including microscopic invertebrates, macro-invertebrates, and small vertebrates, including rodents and fish. Anaerobic bacteria may be important components of the trophic network where organic Carbon and nutrients are abundant but dissolved oxygen is scarce due to either low aeration or high microbial activity. In water supply pipes, low levels of organic carbon and nutrients exacerbate constraints on productivity imposed by the absence of light. Trophic webs within pipes are truncated and simple, and the mostly transitory biota reflects that of source waters.\n\n### Subterranean tidal systems\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Anchialine caves, Anchialine pools, and Sea caves. The subterranean tidal biome includes coastal pools and subterranean voids with a partially or entirely submerged connection to marine waters. Like all other subterranean ecosystems, sunlight is absent or too dim to sustain photosynthesis. Marine shelf ecosystems (M1), terrestrial aquifers (SF1) and surface coastal systems (T, MT) connected to these subterranean systems are their sources of allochthonous energy, nutrients and oxygenation. Food and energy availability are influenced by in situ microbial processing (biogeochemical transformation) of these allochthonous organic matter inputs. The marine interface, a typical feature of coastal aquifers and subterranean estuaries, also generates a marked salinity gradient is the primary zone of biogeochemical cycling. In carbonate and volcanic geologies, the salinity gradient can often be observed in the flooded pools, voids, and caves as a halocline (a sharp salinity gradient in the water column), which is not present in other subterranean environments. In comparison to other subterranean ecosystems, diverse assemblages of chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic microbes, as well as scavengers, filter feeders and predators. Physiological traits enabling osmotic regulation allow some species to transit across haloclines between the fresh- and saline waters. In dark sections of the subterranean marine systems where photoautotrophs are absent, trophic webs are truncated. Some of the subterranean marine biota belong to lineages otherwise restricted to the deep sea floor (M3), and share traits with those in other low- productivity, dark biomes, including depigmentation, reduced visual organs, increased tactile and chemical sensitivity, low fecundity, long lifespans, and slow metabolism and growth rates. Tides are an important means of hydrological mixing, resource flux, biotic dispersal and perturbation. In subterranean tidal systems with more direct connections to the sea, marine suspension feeders, particularly sponges and other sessile invertebrates, are dominant. Farther into marine and anchialine caves, where tidal flushing and water exchange diminishes or disappears, the fauna consists of stygobitic crustaceans, annelids and several other faunal groups (i.e. strictly subterranean aquatic fauna that complete their entire life in this environment).\n\n## ESVD\n\n**Inland Un- or Sparsely Vegetated biome** is comprised of Underground systems, Inland rock formations, and Other (inland un- or sparsely vegetated)\n\n## FEMA ESV\n\nNot defined as a land cover / ecosystem type.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/subterranean.md", "sha": "a8fc259bff28d9f0df8a71874822878c9b22a195", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/land-cover-classification-and-ecosystem-typologies/ecosystem-types/subterranean.md"}}, {"content": "# Urban Green Open Space\n\n## IUCN GET 2.0\n\nThere is no mention of open space or parks in GET 2.0.  The most logical biome is T7 Intensive land-use systems of which Urban Green Open Space would be a part.\n\n### Intensive land-use systems&#x20;\n\nbiome is comprised these Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG): Annual croplands, Sown pastures and fields, Plantations, Urban and industrial ecosystems, Derived semi-natural pastures and oldfields. Intensive land-use systems include major anthropogenic enterprises of cropping, pastoralism, plantation farming, and urbanisation. Human intervention is a dominating influence on this biome, also known as the \u2018anthrome\u2019. Maintenance of these systems is contingent on continuing human interventions, including alterations to the physical structure of vegetation and substrates (e.g. clearing, earthworks and drainage), the supplementation of resources (e.g. with irrigation and fertilisers) and the introduction and control of biota. These interventions maintain disequilibrium community structure and composition, low endemism and low functional and taxonomic diversity. Target biota are genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators and diseases. Non-target biota include widely dispersed, cosmopolitan opportunists with short lifecycles. Many intensive land use systems are maintained as artificial mosaics of contrasting patch types at scales of metres to hundreds of metres. Typically, but not exclusively, they are associated with temperate or subtropical climates and the natural availability of freshwater and nutrients from fertile soils on flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. The antecedent ecosystems that they replaced include forests, shrublands, grasslands and palustrine wetlands (biomes T1\u2212T4 and TF1). On global and regional scales, intensive land- use systems are engaged in climate feedback processes via alterations to the water cycle and the release of greenhouse gases from vegetation, soils, livestock and fossil fuels. On local scales, temperatures may be modified by human-built structures (i.e. heat-island effects) or may be artificially controlled.\n\n## ESVD\n\nPrimarily Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure biome and some of Cultivated Area and/or Inland Un- or Sparsely Vegetated biome classification.\n\n**Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure biome** is comprised of Urban Parks & Forests, Lawns, sports fields, golf courses, Urban lakes, ponds, wetlands, Street Trees & Shrubs, Other (urban green-blue).\n\n**Cultivated Area biome** is comprised of Cropland (arable land), Pastures, Orchards/agro-forestry, Plantations, Rice paddies, Aquaculture, Small landscape elements, Other (cultivated areas). &#x20;\n\n**Inland Un- or Sparsely Vegetated**  is comprised of Underground systems, Inland rock formations, Other (inland un- or sparsely vegetated).

These assets possess both intrinsic value, simply due to their existence, and economic value due to their physical utility to produce goods and services. Classified primarily as Real Estate, Infrastructure, Commodities, and Natural Resources, these assets serve as the backbone of the global economy.   &#x20;\n\nBy combining insights from institutional investors, economic classifications, and legal frameworks, Real Asset classes and types serve as a tool for natural capital investment and ecosystem restoration and conservation initiatives. &#x20;\n\n## Primary Classifications of Real Assets:\n\n### Real Estate\n\nLand and commercial properties including apartments, offices, warehouses, malls, etc. It involves various real property rights, particularly the \u201cbundle of rights\u201d, for its valuation and income generation.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nAssets and networks used to transport, store and distribute goods, energy, people, and information, such as toll roads, pipelines, airports, and cellphone towers.  These are often regulated by long-term contracts or user fees under specific property rights including public private partnerships.\n\n### Commodities\n\nBasic goods such as oil, natural gas, precious metals, gold, corn, and soybeans. These often hold long-term value and may involve mining or harvesting rights.\n\n### Natural Resources\n\nIncludes energy and the extraction of oil & gas, timber, agriculture, mining as commodities. Rights to access and use these resources are essential for their valuation. &#x20;\n\n## Economists' & other Classification\n\n### Durable & nondurable real assets\n\nEconomists often distinguish between durable and nondurable real assets. Durable assets are those employed in wealth production but not consumed in the process. Financial assets, such as stocks, debt, or derivatives, represent claims to the income and value derived from real assets by legal rights.\n\n### RWA: Real World Assets\n\nIn the context of crypto and blockchain, RWA's signify the tokenization and integration of tangible, physical assets into the digital DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystems. This process allows these assets to be managed, traded, and leveraged on blockchain platforms, marrying traditional financial assets with the blockchain's efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. Examples include tokenized real estate enabling fractional ownership, commodities like metals and agricultural products made easily tradable without physical handling, and blockchain-based funding or management of infrastructure and natural resources projects. RWAs aim to broaden blockchain utility, bringing liquidity, innovation, and inclusivity to diverse assets.\n\n## Real Property Law & the Bundle of Rights\n\nDepending on jurisdiction and type, real assets are subject to real property law and associated rights, including what's commonly referred to as the \"bundle of rights.\"\n\nThe bundle of rights concept outlines various privileges, entitlements, and legal capacities related to real estate ownership. This \"bundle\" comprises:\n\n* Right to Possess: Ownership and the authority to occupy the property.\n* Right to Use and Enjoy: Utilizing the property for personal or economic benefits such as leasing.\n* Right to Control and Manage: Determining how the property is used or managed, including the right to income derived from it.\n* Right to Dispose or Transmissibility\\*\\*: The power to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the property, including bequeathal after death.\n* Right to Exclude: Preventing others from entering the property or prohibiting specific uses.\n\nThese rights are often subject to limitations like local laws, HOAs, or specific agreements such as deed restrictions and conservation easements.\n\n## Additional Real Property Rights\n\nWhile the bundle of rights covers a broad spectrum of legal entitlements, it is not exhaustive. Other specific types of rights related to natural resources, such as water rights, mineral rights, and air rights, also play significant roles in real asset classifications:\n\n* **Air Rights**: These are often categorized as \"development rights,\" allowing the owner of a parcel of land to control, occupy, or use the vertical space above the property. These rights can be sold or leased independently of the land itself. They are particularly relevant in urban settings where vertical development is common.\n* **Water Rights**: These are generally \"use rights\" that permit the owner or leaseholder to use water from a specific source, be it a river, stream, or underground aquifer, for specified purposes such as irrigation, industrial processes, or consumption. These rights can be particularly complex, as they can vary by jurisdiction and may be subject to local, state, or federal regulations.\n* **Mineral Rights**: These are typically \"exploitation or extraction rights,\" granting the owner or lessee the exclusive right to mine, extract, sell, or lease minerals that exist beneath the surface of the property. These rights can be sold or leased separately from the property itself.\n\nEach of these types of rights can be legally distinct and can be sold, leased, or transferred independently of the other rights associated with the property. They are subject to regulation and may have different characteristics depending on the jurisdiction in which the property is located.\n\n## Emerging Rights\n\nIn the realm of nature-based solutions, natural capital, and conservation, an evolving set of rights is increasingly being leveraged to address climate change and protect biodiversity. These rights extend beyond traditional property and resource rights to facilitate restoration, carbon sequestration, and aesthetic preservation. Key types include:\n\n* **Carbon Rights**: These pertain to the ownership and control over the carbon dioxide storage and sequestration capabilities of a property. Carbon rights enable landowners to generate and sell carbon credits, which in turn incentivize CO2-reducing activities like reforestation.\n* **Natural Asset Rights**: Distinct from natural resource rights, which are often focused on extraction, Natural Asset Rights pertain to the restoration and conservation of ecosystems. These rights facilitate the creation and trading of biodiversity credits and contribute to habitat restoration initiatives.\n* **View Rights**: Also known as viewsheds or view corridors, these rights are designed to protect the visual integrity and scenic beauty of a landscape. Often established through easements or zoning laws, view rights can impact property values and contribute to regional aesthetic and cultural preservation.\n\nBoth Carbon and Natural Asset Rights are instrumental in the development of emerging certification programs such as carbon and biodiversity credits. These novel rights serve to monetize environmental services, thereby making conservation and restoration activities more financially viable and investable.\n\n## Usufruct and Leasing\n\nThe modern concept of leasing has roots in the ancient legal principle of \u201cusufruct\u201d. Usufruct is a legal concept that originates from Roman law, which allows one individual to use and derive income or benefit (\u201cfruit\u201d) from someone else's property without altering the property itself. The property can be land, a building, or even resources like minerals, water, and timber.\n\nUsufruct essentially allows a person to enjoy the \"fruits\" of a property, both natural (like crops) and civil (like rental income), without harming or diminishing the property. This notion has evolved over time to give rise to various forms of leasing and tenancy arrangements in contemporary law.\n\nIn modern leasing agreements, the lessee gains the right to use an asset for a specified period in return for making regular payments to the lessor. The underlying asset could be real property, such as a building or land, or personal property, like a car or equipment. While the lessor maintains the ownership of the asset, the lessee gains the right to use it, much like in usufruct.\n\nBoth concepts are fundamentally grounded in the principle of temporary possession and utilization of assets, where one party benefits from an asset that legally belongs to someone else. &#x20;\n\n### Leases\n\nLeasing is a contractual arrangement allowing one party (the lessee) to use another party's (the lessor's) property for a specified time and specific use, typically in exchange for a periodic payment. Types of leases include:\n\n* **Sub-Leasing**: An arrangement where the original lessee sublets the property to a third party but still maintains a lease relationship with the original lessor. The sub-lessee pays rent to the lessee, who in turn continues to pay rent to the lessor.\n* **Master Lease Agreement**: a pre-established contractual framework that outlines the terms and conditions between a lessor (property owner) and lessee (tenant). Designed to be applicable to future leasing transactions, it simplifies the process for leasing multiple properties or assets and allows for the streamlined sub-leasing of a single property to various sub-tenants. In this arrangement, the lessor's primary point of contact is the main lessee, reducing the administrative burden as the lessor does not have to engage directly with the sub-tenants. This setup creates operational efficiencies for both the lessor and the primary lessee.\n* **Ground Lease**: A lease of the land only, often for long-term periods. The lessee may construct buildings or make other improvements to the land during the lease period. At the end of the lease term, all improvements generally revert to the landowner unless otherwise specified.\n* **Leasehold**: A form of property tenure where a person holds rights to a property by virtue of a lease agreement. Unlike freehold or fee simple, leasehold properties are 'owned' for a fixed term but not in perpetuity. Long term leasehold arrangements are common in commercial real estate. &#x20;\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll types of real assets depend on real property law and real property rights to certain extents. The bundle of rights that is commonly known as real estate is a tool for understanding the rights and limitations associated with these types of real assets.&#x20;\n\nIn the realms of natural capital, ecological assets, biodiversity credits, and payments for ecosystem services, the application of real property law is essential for achieving favorable outcomes. Though there is a significant need for, and ongoing efforts towards, real property law and land use reform in various regions, its astute utilization serves as a potent instrument for both immediate and long-term benefits.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/real-asset-classification-and-real-property-considerations.md", "sha": "41c9c1bed74cc55dab02fb9021fa126e02101f14", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/real-asset-classification-and-real-property-considerations.md"}}, {"content": "# Selected Value Types & Valuation Methods\n\nFor the purposes of our work of expressing the [RealValue of Natural Capital](broken-reference) we narrowed down the value types and valuation methods applicable to establishing the the higher and better use of real assets and valuation of Nature's Core Benefits. Before we dive into the our selected types and methods we must clarify:\n\n## Why we are NOT using DCF and NPV\n\nSeveral frameworks, particularly those in financial and economic disciplines, rely heavily on Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) Analysis or Net Present Value (NPV) Comparison for valuation. However, these methodologies are not suitable for calculating RealValue for several reasons.\n\n### Time Sensitivity\n\nOur approach focuses on capturing the RealValue at a specific point in time. This is critical for understanding both the current ecosystem function and condition, as well as assessing actionable interventions. DCF and NPV, in contrast, lean on projections extending over multiple periods, such as 5, 10, or even 20 years. The longer the time horizon, the more susceptible these models are to errors and market volatility.\n\n### Accuracy and Manipulation Risks\n\nDCF and NPV not only depend on forecasts, but they can also be sensitive to various assumptions, including discount rates. This leaves substantial room for error or even manipulation. With varying discount rates and projected cash flows, one can easily tailor DCF and NPV calculations to produce a value that aligns more with what is desired rather than what is accurate.\n\n### Focus on Immediate RealValue\n\nOur RealValue Natural Capitalization Rate formula, which combines Net Operating Income (NOI) with Ecosystem Service Value (ESV), divided by the Real Asset Value, aims to provide a more immediate and tangible measure of value. This approach allows us to define specific interventions based on current ecosystem condition and the affects on value. After implementing these interventions, we can then re-measure RealValue to assess the actual impact on ecosystem functionality and asset value.\n\n### Complexity and Real-world Applicability\n\nWhile DCF and NPV can be highly complex and demand a series of speculative assumptions, RealValue aims for simplicity and real-world applicability. The DCF model may involve complex calculations that require assumptions about future market conditions, cash flows, and discount rates. NPV, meanwhile, focuses strictly on financial returns and often neglects non-financial variables such as environmental impact, social values, and other intangibles that are increasingly important in today's investment landscape.\n\nBy avoiding the pitfalls associated with DCF and NPV, we believe the **RealValue methodology offers a more accurate, actionable, and immediate understanding of an asset's worth and its impact on ecosystem function and condition**.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/selected-value-types-and-valuation-methods/README.md", "sha": "4d56a426b81b8739b086f7f64b18ec93b9aa542a", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/selected-value-types-and-valuation-methods/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Ecosystem Service Values\n\nBelieve it or not, the phrase \u201cEcosystem Service Value\u201d (ESV), although extensively used and repeated both in the title and body of reviewed works, is not a defined term in any of the frameworks.\n\n**We define Ecosystem Service Value as:**&#x20;\n\n_the quantifiable benefit, either monetary or non-monetary, that humans derive from the natural functions and processes of ecosystems. This value encompasses a wide range of services, including but not limited to, the provision of resources, regulation of environmental factors, support for biological diversity, cultural or recreational as well as aesthetic and spiritual benefits._&#x20;\n\nThe concept of ESV is commonly used to facilitate informed decision-making in areas such as land use, conservation, and sustainable management as well as for cost benefit analysis.\n\nEcosystem Service Values and TEV have been used in seminal works like Costanza and de Groot\u2019s \u201cThe value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital\u201d and subsequent \u201cChanges in the global value of ecosystem services\u201d; OECD\u2019s \u201cBiodiversity: Finance and the Economic and Business Case for Action\u201d; and Brander\u2019s \u201cThe Total Economic Value of U.S. Coral Reefs\u201d to estimate and express the value, in dollars, of ecosystems and the services they provide.\n\nDatabases like Environmental Valuation Reference Inventory (EVRI) from Environment Canada and BlueValue from Texas A\\&M contain thousands (5,000+) of environmental and health valuation studies that provide estimated monetary values of ecosystems and specific ESVs.

The ESVD currently contains 9,500 value records from over 1100 studies distributed across all biomes, ecosystem services and geographic regions.\n\nBoth FEMA ESV and ESVD break down ESV by space (ac or ha) and time (year) and express the resulting ESV in dollars and of course provide details on each study and the valuation method utilized.\n\n## Common Valuation Methods:\n\n* Contingent Valuation\n* Hedonic Pricing\n* Market Price\n* Meta-Analysis\n* Production Function Approach\n* Replacement Cost\n* Social Cost of Carbon\n* Travel Cost\n* Unit Value Transfer\n* Value Transfer (Benefits Transfer)\n* Total Economic Value\n\n### Additional Methods in ESVD:\n\n* Damage Cost Avoided\n* Defensive Expenditure\n* Group Valuation (Participatory Valuation)\n* Input-Output Modelling\n* Net Factor Income (Residual Value)\n* Opportunity Cost\n* Public Pricing\n* Restoration Cost\n\n**Note**: Most methods from both lists are also utilized in SEEA EA and TEEB frameworks.\n\n## Stocks & Flows\n\nMany ESV studies provide a lump sum \"stock\" value of particular polygons or ecosystems.  This typically involves estimating the number of years of value and then discounting to a NPV. However, other ESV studies provide annual values (temporal) by ecosystem extent (spatial).&#x20;\n\nAligning with common practices in investment real estate valuation, RealValue uses ESV in $ per acre per year ($/ac/yr). When combined with financial annual income from an asset, we call the total annual value the \"flow\" value. With the underlying real asset value being the \"stock\" value.\n\n_**Note**_: as we are in the US we use acres however, this can easily be converted to hectares.\n\n## The Foundation of RealValue\n\nFor RealValue we utilize a broad yet select set ESV data, based on our customized adjustments, reconciliations, and formula, to calculate value transfer estimates and meta-analytic values that can be applied to any Ecological Polygon to provide an estimate the holistic value in dollars.&#x20;\n\nRealValue is expressed in $/yr for a given polygon and the relation to Real Asset Value is expressed as a Natural Capitalization Rate: FLOWS/STOCKS = Natural Cap Rate.

Instrumental value includes economic values, regardless whether the entity is directly or indirectly used, or not used (existence and bequest values).\n* **Intrinsic values** refers to the value of an entity (e.g., an organism, an ecological process) independent of how it relates to humans.\n* **Relational values** are associated to the meaningfulness of relationships, including the relationships among humans and nature and among humans, including across generations, via nature (Chan et al., 2016). These values are attached to the entity itself in ways that make it not substitutable, hence not serving an instrumental or utilitarian perspective (O\u2019Neill, 2017), and represent what people consider meaningful about nature (e.g., attachment, responsibility, commitment). Relational values can also be associated with relationships with nature towards achieving a good life, e.g., when choosing \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d or in the context of a \u201cmeaningful life.\u201d (Pascual et al., 2017). (IPBES)\n\n## Total Economic Value (TEV)\n\nTotal Economic Value (TEV) is covered extensively in TEEB and referenced in SEEA. Here we provide a consolidated definition of TEV:\n\n_Total Economic Value (TEV) is a comprehensive framework used for evaluating the utilitarian value of ecosystems and biodiversity. TEV quantifies the economic importance of natural capital by aggregating multiple types of values that humans derive from ecosystem services, both currently and in the future. These values are usually expressed in monetary terms or other market-based units to facilitate comparison and policy-making._\n\nTEV is categorized into two main types of values:\n\n1\\) **Use Values**: These are the values derived from the direct or indirect utilization of ecosystem services for consumption or production. They include:\n\n* **Direct Use Values**: Services that are consumed directly, such as harvesting food, timber, or medicinal products. Direct use can be either consumptive (reducing the availability of the good for others) or nonconsumptive (not reducing the good's availability).\n* **Indirect Use Values**: These are services used as intermediate inputs for the production of other goods and services. Examples include soil nutrients, water purification, and pollination services.\n* **Option Values**: These are values attached to preserving the option to use services in the future, either by the individual or by others. They also include the quasi-option value, which is the value of delaying irreversible decisions until more information becomes available.\n\n2\\) **Non-use Values**: These values are not linked to any current or future use but represent the value people place on the mere existence of a resource. This category often includes:\n\n* **Existence Value**: The value people ascribe to knowing that a resource exists, even if they never use it directly.\n\n&#x20;In addition to these categories, TEV also recognizes the concept of **Insurance Value**, which relates to [**the value of ensuring that there are no irreversible negative shifts in the ecosystem that could harm human wellbeing**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].\n\nMethods for estimating TEV vary and include direct market approaches, revealed preferences, and stated preference techniques.&#x20;\n\n<mark style=\"background-color:yellow;\">**In essence, RealValue is an iteration of TEV that is based on the practical application of real assets and real property law and investment fundamentals.

Real Estate is essentially the \u201cstocks\u201d of natural capital from a pragmatic approach.\n\n## Market Value\n\nThe Appraisal Institute defines \u201cmarket value\u201d in \u201dThe Appraisal of Real Estate, 14th Edition\" as:\n\n_Market value is the most probable price that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:_\n\n* _Buyer and seller are typically motivated;_\n* _Both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest;_\n* _A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;_\n* _Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto;_\n* _The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale._\n\n## Approaches to Value\n\nThere are three primary approaches to value use in real estate appraisal: Cost Approach, Market Approach, Income Approach.  They are generally defined by the Appraisal Institute as:&#x20;\n\n### Cost Approach\n\nBased on the principle of substitution, this approach estimates the cost to construct a replica or replacement for the existing structure, deducts the accrued depreciation, and adds the estimated land value. The cost approach is often useful for estimating the value of properties for which there are no recent comparable sales.\n\n### Sales Comparison Approach (Market)\n\nThe approach is based on the principle of substitution, which assumes that a buyer will not pay more for a property than the cost of an equally desirable alternative. Comparable sales are identified, and adjustments are made for differences between the comparables and the subject property to derive a value indication.\n\n### Income Capitalization Approach\n\nThe Income Approach converts future or current benefits of property ownership into a value indication through capitalization or discounting. Anticipated income streams and a reversion are converted into present value through a capitalization rate or discount rate. This approach is commonly used for income-producing properties.\n\n## Other Methods\n\nOther commonly used and accepted real property valuation methods are:\n\n* Broker Price Opinion (BPO): A valuation by a licensed real estate broker, often used for quick estimates. It's less detailed and less expensive than a full appraisal, considering factors like comparable sales and property condition.\n* Automated Valuation Model (AVM): A tech-based system, like Zillow's Zestimate, that estimates property value using algorithms. While quick and convenient, it's generally less accurate than a formal appraisal.\n* Assessed Value: The value assigned by a tax assessor for taxation purposes, usually a percentage of the property's market value. It forms the basis for the property owner's tax liability.\n\n## Valuation of Other Real Assets and Businesses\n\nFor assets like infrastructure, commodities, and natural resources, or for valuing businesses as going concerns, traditional real estate appraisal methods may not be applicable. In such cases, the most suitable valuation approach should be selected based on the specific context and circumstances.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/selected-value-types-and-valuation-methods/real-asset-values/README.md", "sha": "f8144e4ba121f4f685c94571c6cd2c578baca6a8", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/selected-value-types-and-valuation-methods/real-asset-values/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Cap Rate Overview\n\nCap rates, short for capitalization rates, are a fundamental concept in real estate investment that help investors assess the return on investment of a property. Here's a basic but comprehensive summary of what they are, how they are calculated, and how they are used:\n\n#### What Are Cap Rates?\n\n* **Definition**: The cap rate is a metric used to evaluate the potential return on an investment property. It represents the ratio of the property's net operating income (NOI) to its current market value or purchase price.\n* **Purpose**: Cap rates provide a quick, initial look at the investment potential of a property without considering mortgage financing, offering a way to compare different real estate investments.\n\n#### How Are They Calculated?\n\nThe formula to calculate a cap rate is relatively straightforward:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n* **Net Operating Income (NOI)**: This is the annual income generated by the property through rents and other fees, minus the annual operating expenses (excluding mortgage payments). Operating expenses include things like maintenance, management fees, insurance, and taxes.\n* **Current Market Value or Purchase Price**: This is the value of the property or the price at which it's bought.\n\n#### How Are They Used?\n\n1. **Investment Comparison**: Cap rates are particularly useful for comparing the potential return of different real estate investments in a standardized way. A higher cap rate suggests a higher return on investment, but also potentially higher risk.\n2. **Market Trends**: Analyzing cap rates across different markets or sectors can indicate the general direction of the real estate market, helping investors identify hotspots or areas with potential for growth.\n3. **Property Valuation**: By rearranging the cap rate formula, investors can estimate the value of a property based on its NOI and the typical cap rate for similar properties in the area. This is useful for buyers and sellers in negotiating prices.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Cap rates also reflect the perceived risk of an investment. Properties in stable, less risky areas typically have lower cap rates, while those in areas perceived as riskier offer higher cap rates to compensate for the additional risk.\n\n#### Considerations\n\n* **Market Variability**: Cap rates vary widely by location, property type, and market conditions. It's important to compare cap rates within the same market and sector for accurate assessments.\n* **Not the Only Metric**: While useful, cap rates are just one of many metrics investors should consider. Other factors, such as growth potential, financing terms, and tax implications, also play crucial roles in investment decisions.\n\nCap rates offer a snapshot of potential investment returns, making them a valuable tool in the real estate investor's toolkit. However, they should be used in conjunction with other analyses to make informed investment choices.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/selected-value-types-and-valuation-methods/real-asset-values/cap-rate-overview.md", "sha": "eec979a90fad648f3c8b0642f6b2ba529f061a94", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/selected-value-types-and-valuation-methods/real-asset-values/cap-rate-overview.md"}}, {"content": "# Value Types & Valuation Methods\n\n{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nBASIN's [RealValue of Natural Capital](broken-reference) was built based on the process and supporting materials found in this Appendix.\n{% endhint %}\n\nTo ascertain the \"RealValue\" of Natural Capital, our investigation delves into various types of value and the valuation methods that have been adopted across different cultures and economies globally. We've considered the historical evolution of these value types, their current applications, and their potential utility in ecosystem restoration and conservation initiatives.\n\nThe concept of \"value\" is deeply embedded across multiple disciplines such as economics, philosophy, and social sciences, each offering different lenses through which to view worth or importance. In economics, the transition from labor theories to marginalist theory highlights the shifting understanding of value, from an objective measure to one that is more subjective and determined by individual preferences. Philosophical perspectives on value have been shaped by moral and ethical frameworks that assess the intrinsic qualities of ideas or actions. Sociocultural perspectives add another layer of complexity, often hinging on community or societal norms. Even in art and finance, value takes on multiple dimensions, be it aesthetic, emotional, or monetary.\n\nWithin the scope of real assets, natural capital, and ecosystem services, the notion of value gains even more facets. Modern interpretations now include environmental and social governance (ESG) metrics. Emerging markets like carbon credits and biodiversity credits, as well as the concept of \"regenerative finance,\" continue to redefine what constitutes \"value.\" Regenerative finance aims to align capital allocation with sustainable practices that not only maintain but also improve natural and social systems.\n\nThis appendix serves as an overview and foundation for understanding how these concepts interact with the sectors of real assets, natural capital, and ecosystem services. Our goal is to shed light on how different valuation methodologies can be applied or adapted to promote ecosystem restoration and conservation, aligning financial incentives with sustainable practices.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/value-types-and-valuation-methods/README.md", "sha": "8bb1f5a6ae581b2da0403111fbcfeee30a225aa8", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/value-types-and-valuation-methods/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Types of Value\n\nIn an exhaustive survey across diverse domains\u2014from economics and business to art, luxury goods, philosophy, social customs, real estate, investment, finance, and insurance\u2014we identified **over 300 types of value**.

These may overlap or diverge depending on the user's perspective. While value is most frequently expressed in quantitative terms like dollars, it also manifests in various qualitative forms and is commonly classified as instrumental value, intrinsic value, and relational value.\n\n### Cost, Price, & Value\n\nGenerally:\n\n* **Cost** refers to the actual expense incurred to build or acquire something and is closely related to price.\n* **Price** is essentially the market value of an asset, representing the most probable selling price in a competitive, open market.\n* **Value** can span from human-centered market value (**instrumental value**) to the invaluable or infinite (**intrinsic value**), as well as **relational value**, which describes an asset's worth in relation to other entities, be they living or non-living, across both space and time.\n\nDepending on the valuation method, user perspective, and ultimate goal of the valuation, other specific types of value are inherent in the broader categories of cost, price, and value. These include but are not limited to:&#x20;\n\n* use and non-use value\n* market and non-market value\n* total economic value (TEV)\n* replacement cost\n* insurable value\n* investment value\n* net asset value (NAV).\n\n### Two Primary Types of Value\n\nIn our quest for the \"RealValue\" of Natural Capital, we recognize nature's intrinsic value as priceless. However, we also acknowledge the need to express this value in a common language that everyone understands, dollars, to avoid further degrading the biodiversity that comprises our biosphere. Two types of value are .\n\nOur analysis reveals two primary types of value that can easily be expressed in dollars and are particularly relevant to real assets and ecosystem services: anthropocentric value and public goods value.\n\n* **Anthropocentric Value** encompass widely recognized forms of value, including a property's market value and the income it generates. Anthropocentric Value is also referred to as financial value.\n* **Public Goods Value**, historically considered positive externalities, refer to the common benefits nature provides at no charge. Ecosystem services serve as the most appropriate classification for these values. \"Public Goods\" are generally those from which society at large benefits and which may not be privately owned or are hard to exclude people from enjoying. These have both intrinsic and instrumental values that often extend beyond the boundaries of a \"property\".  Public Goods Value is also referred to as economic value.\n\nThe following \"Valuation Methods\" section elaborates on how these values are quantified, focusing on real assets and ecosystem services. &#x20;\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/value-types-and-valuation-methods/types-of-value/README.md", "sha": "dc20c301960ff336977d611a37612380eba9fc05", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/value-types-and-valuation-methods/types-of-value/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Values Across Cultures\n\nThe [IPBES Diverse Values and Valuation of Nature](../../../dossier/manifesto.md) paper is an extensive work and a highly recommended resource on types of values across culture.\n\nAdditionally, we looked at _intrinsic value_ and _well-being_ beliefs across cultures.&#x20;\n\n{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nThis section is an evolving work and, as always, we welcome your contribution.\n{% endhint %}\n\n## Intrinsic Value & Well-being Beliefs Across Cultures\n\n### Ohenton Kariwatehkwen\n\nOhenton Kariwatehkwen, known as the Thanksgiving Address, is a profound ceremonial expression from the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people, encapsulating gratitude towards every aspect of the natural world. It serves as a reminder of humanity's deep interconnectedness with nature, acknowledging the sun, moon, water, earth, plants, and animals for their contributions to life's sustenance. This address is both an opening and closing to gatherings, emphasizing the importance of thankfulness and recognition of the natural balance and harmony that sustains life, reflecting a deep respect for and unity with the environment.\n\n### Whakapapa\n\nWhakapapa is a foundational concept in M\u0101ori culture, embodying the genealogical connections between all entities \u2014 human, environmental, and spiritual. It asserts that individuals are directly linked to their ancestors, the land, and the cosmos, forming a continuous chain of being and belonging that transcends time. Whakapapa is not just a lineage recitation; it's a way of understanding the world, emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual responsibilities between people and the natural world. This concept underscores the intrinsic value of all life forms and their integral roles within the ecosystem.\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nUbuntu is a Nguni Bantu term often translated as \"I am because we are,\" reflecting a philosophy of mutual respect, community life, and interconnectedness among people and between individuals and the natural world. Originating from Southern African cultures, Ubuntu emphasizes compassion, humanity, and the communal bond that defines human experience. It teaches that our well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others, including the natural environment, advocating for a life of harmony, respect, and empathy towards all beings.\n\n### Buen Vivir\n\nBuen Vivir, or \"good living,\" is a concept and practice emerging from Indigenous Andean cultures, particularly the Quechua and Aymara peoples, which proposes a way of life that is in harmony with nature. It contrasts with Western notions of development, focusing instead on communal well-being, environmental stewardship, and the balance between human needs and the preservation of the planet. Buen Vivir embodies the idea that true prosperity is found in living well within one's community and ecosystem rather than in material accumulation, advocating for a holistic approach to development that respects Pachamama (Mother Earth).\n\n### Djalkiri\n\nDjalkiri is a Yol\u014bu term from Northeast Arnhem Land in Australia, denoting the foundational principles and deep spiritual connections between the Yol\u014bu people and their Country. It represents the ancestral footprints and laws laid down by the creators, guiding the living in their relationship with the land, sea, and spiritual entities. Djalkiri emphasizes the responsibility to care for and maintain the balance of the environment, highlighting the reciprocal relationship between people and Country, where both are custodians and beneficiaries of the land's spiritual and physical abundance.\n\n### Ngurra\n\nNgurra refers to the concept of home and country among some Aboriginal Australian groups, particularly in the Western Desert regions. It embodies the deep connection to land, encompassing not just the physical place but also the cultural, spiritual, and emotional ties that bind people to their ancestral territories. Ngurra is a place of belonging, identity, and responsibility, where the land and its people are inseparable, and caring for the country is an integral part of life. This concept illustrates the complex relationships and obligations to the land, highlighting the intrinsic value and mutual care between the land and its Indigenous custodians.\n\n### Satoyama\n\nSatoyama is a Japanese term that represents a traditional rural landscape where the balance between humans and nature is maintained through centuries-old practices that enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services. Satoyama landscapes include mixed forests, rice paddies, irrigation ponds, and grasslands, which are managed in ways that create a mosaic of habitats supporting a wide variety of species. This concept emphasizes the importance of human stewardship of the natural environment in a manner that sustains and enriches biodiversity, demonstrating the symbiotic relationship between people and nature.\n\n### Sila\n\nIn Inuit philosophy, Sila is a concept that encompasses the weather, balance, and consciousness, reflecting the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment in the Arctic. It represents the breath of life and the force that connects all beings, emphasizing the respect and understanding required to live in harmony with the vast, dynamic, and often harsh natural landscapes of the Arctic. Sila teaches the importance of recognizing the sentience and agency of the natural world, underscoring the deep relationship between the Inuit people and their environment.\n", "metadata": {"path": "appendix/value-types-and-valuation-methods/types-of-value/values-across-cultures.md", "sha": "d48ca21cca8dcc6ef20b8b466f60ebd26b1b8fdd", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/appendix/value-types-and-valuation-methods/types-of-value/values-across-cultures.md"}}, {"content": "# Valuation Methods\n\nIn our exhaustive review of diverse resources, we pinpointed various valuation methods relevant to both real assets and ecosystem services valuation (ESV).

Ensurance\n\nUnlike traditional insurance, which is retroactive, Ensurance is proactive, focusing on the protection ecosystems from day one while providing a definitive path to permanent protection along with restoration and stewardship funding. Ensurance Policies and Certificates of Ensurance are issued for specific Ecological Polygons (EPs) as part of the BASIN Protocol.\n\n## How it Works\n\nUtilizing the RealValue of Natural Capital framework for specific ecological polygons (properties), Ecological Ensurance 1) properly values the stocks and flows of natural capital, 2) triangulates the relational value of the underlying real asset and natural capital value, and 3) outputs a range of financially viable options that ensure the immediate and permanent protection and regeneration of the EP.\n\n## Key components of Ecological Ensurance\n\n### Ensurance\n\nEnsures that ecosystems and the benefits they provide, including biodiversity, will permanently be protected and stewarded.\n\n### Ensurance Policy&#x20;\n\nThe Policy is the specifications of the Ensurance coverage, cost, and length.\n\n### Ensurance Slip\n\nSlips are the precursor to policies with each slip containing all the preliminary data needed for a EP to be considered for a formal policy.\n\n### Ensurance Premium\n\nThe premium is the annual cost of the Ensurance Policy. The premium is calculated based off of the relationship between the annual RealValue, capital providers (Ensurers), and the underlying real asset cost/value. This relationship calculates cost options to put the ecosystem in permanent trust either today, 2030, 2040, or 2050. Alternatively, Ensurance Premiums can be calculated for any custom # of years including a minimum premium amount which is the lowest cost but only protects the ecosystem year by year, not permanently.\n\n{% hint style=\"success\" %}\nThe term \"premium\" has its origins in the Latin word \"praemium,\" which means \"reward\" or \"prize.\" While premium has different meanings today, the historical definition is highly applicable to Ensurance: premiums were seen as payments for securing a service or benefit, often with a positive connotation of receiving something valuable in return. What greater value is there than [regenerative wealth](../provenance/what-you-seek.md)?\n{% endhint %}\n\n### Certificates of Ensurance\n\nCertificates Ensurance have a dual purpose as 1) the individual units of the RealValue of Natural Capital specific to the EP and 2) 1:1 common interests in the overall BASIN Protocol. Certificates are issued for each EP based on the Ensurance rate calculations. Notably, the difference between the RealValue and the highest viable Ensurance Premium is put on Nature\u2019s Balance Sheet and distributed to Nature itself via the BASIN Protocol. In other words, only the absolute minimum number of certificates required to make the ensurance effective are available for purchase, the rest remain in the Protocol.\n\n### Ensurance Underwriter&#x20;\n\nThe underwriter is responsible for evaluating and deciding the risk of ensuring ecological polygons, determining policy terms, setting premium prices, working with Ensurers, Ensurance Agents and the Ensured.\n\n### Ensurer&#x20;\n\naka Ensurance carrier, the Ensurer issues the Ensurance policy, bearing the risk in exchange for Ensurance premiums paid by the Policyholder and/or the Ensured. Ensurer\u2019s are BASIN Members that are either market rate investors, philanthropic funders, or blended finance vehicles that fund the real asset cost upfront and during the policy period.\n\n### Ensurance Policyholder\n\nThis is the primary or majority holder of the ensurance policy and is often times the payor of the premium. Importantly, only the Policyholder gets the official claim on the ecological indicator data from the ensured polygon.\n\n### Ensured&#x20;\n\nUnique to Ensurance, the Ensured is nature itself, which by definition includes humans and our constructs of society and economy. The Ensured is the ecology of place: the ecosystem and species themselves, the land owner, neighbors, the region, and the direct, indirect, and cumulative beneficiaries of ecosystem system services. The BASIN Protocol is the payment mechanism by and for the Ensured.\n\n### Ensurance Agents&#x20;\n\nAgents are members of the BASIN Protocol who are seeking to fund their own nature and climate projects or help others fund their projects. Ensurance Agents help source and underwrite Ensurance polices and sell Certificates of Ensurance.\n\n### Entrust&#x20;\n\nOnce the the Ensurance Premium has been paid in full and the Ensurance Policy has ended, the EP (land/ecosystem) goes into permanent trust. The trust structure is outlined in the BASIN Protocol.\n", "metadata": {"path": "ensurance/ecological-ensurance.md", "sha": "47685fbd1dd81ce89cdc8a1f96d62f3b29dd5bbc", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/ensurance/ecological-ensurance.md"}}, {"content": "# Ensurance Examples\n\nEcological Ensurance can be seen in action in the [BASIN Ensurance Binder](https://binder.basin.global/).\n\n## Example of an [83 acre wetland](https://binder.basin.global/slips/ecological-ensurance-slips/83-acre-wetland-and-forest-southeast-savannas-and-riparian-bioregion) in the Binder\n\n<figure><img src=\"../.gitbook/assets/ensurance example.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n", "metadata": {"path": "ensurance/ensurance-examples.md", "sha": "86daa3a46814175a68c67dd35fc13eaef633b0eb", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/ensurance/ensurance-examples.md"}}, {"content": "# .BASIN\n\n**.basin** accounts are perpetual purpose trusts that **ensure** the protection, restoration, and stewardship of PLACE, on PURPOSE, by PEOPLE. &#x20;\n\n.basin\u2019s represent the **stocks** of natural capital and work in conjunction with STREAMS which represent the **flows** of natural capital.\n\nAs a platform cooperative, [.basin's](.basin.md) are 1:1 membership of the protocol, while STREAMS function as patronage certificates, reflecting the collaborative and dynamic nature of how BASIN STREAMS work together.\n\n{% hint style=\"success\" %}\nWe commonly refer to .basin's as a \"dot basin\", a BASIN, or [$BASIN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BASIN)\n{% endhint %}\n\n## .basin Contract\n\n**.basin** is the primary BASIN Protocol contract.&#x20;\n\nAs an ERC-721 (6551 enabled) contract deployed on BASE, every .basin name is unique, has its own token ID, and it's own 0x account.&#x20;\n\n<table data-full-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th width=\"164\">contract name</th><th width=\"93\">Symbol</th><th>address</th><th data-type=\"content-ref\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.basin</td><td>.BASIN</td><td>0x76ac406218413950db2b050f7c3449ab5e24aabc</td><td><a href=\"https://basescan.org/token/0x76ac406218413950db2b050f7c3449ab5e24aabc\">https://basescan.org/token/0x76ac406218413950db2b050f7c3449ab5e24aabc</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nThe original .basin contract on Polygon has been depracated and should not be used.\n{% endhint %}\n\n## .basin 0x's (Tokenbound Accounts)\n\nThe .basin contract is ERC-6551 Tokenbound Account (TBA) enabled with every .basin having its own cross chain EVM 0x address.  .basin's can hold and manage any amount and assortment of ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens, i.e. ETH, USDC, MATIC, NFT's etc\n\n### Finding .basin 0x addresses\n\nSpecific .basin 0x's can be found several ways. &#x20;\n\nThe easiest is to keyword search the .basin collection page on OpenSea or Rarible for the .basin you are looking for.

(This feature coming soon to confluence.basin.global.)\n\nThe other way is to go to Tokenbound.org with the .basin contract address in the url and the token ID at the end.  For example this is elk.basin token ID 386:\n\n[https://tokenbound.org/assets/base/0x76AC406218413950DB2b050f7C3449AB5E24AABc/386](https://tokenbound.org/assets/base/0x76AC406218413950DB2b050f7C3449AB5E24AABc/386)\n\n### Managing assets inside your .basin\n\nAssets inside .basin's can be managed from the [tokenbound.org app](https://tokenbound.org/) by connecting your wallet that the .basin resides in. This functionality will also be available on BASIN's dApp soon.\n\n### Connect with and use your .basin\n\n.basin's are essentially smart contract wallets, giving it the ability to do anything a wallet can. That means you can use your .basin to connect to websites and dApps using WalletConnect and perform actions on behalf of your NFT.

They are integrated into our collective economic, legal, and social frameworks as real assets and real property.\n\nIn real asset valuation, the prevailing approach prioritizes the 'highest and best use' of a property, emphasizing the maximization of financial returns and profitability. To maximize profit, properties are developed based on what is legally permissible and physically possible, leading to significant land use changes to accommodate human use and consumption. This valuation paradigm results in the destruction of ecosystems and the loss of the benefits they provide.\n\nIn contrast, RealValue establishes the 'higher and better use' of real assets by emphasizing the importance of accounting for the benefits provided by nature and valuing natural capital in monetary terms. This approach presents a compelling alternative for determining how a 'property' should be utilized, juxtaposing short-sighted valuations with holistic assessments that consider the broader ecological context.\n\n## RealValue Composition&#x20;\n\nRealValue is comprised of and calculated based on two main components: Ecological Polygon and RealValues.\n\n### Ecological Polygon\n\nThis is ecosystem that is being valued consisting of extent, characteristics, and condition.\n\n### RealValues\n\nThese are the individual values of the Core Benefits converted to and expressed in dollar values.\n\n## RealValue Expression\n\nRealValue is expressed via two metrics and one indicator:\n\n* **Stocks**: real asset dollar ($) value at a point in time (lump sum _metric_). The stocks value is the 'real world' price, cost, or value of a polygon (the underlying real asset).\n* **Flows**: annual economic and financial dollar ($/yr) values (annual _metric_). Economic values are referred to as Public Goods Values and financial values as Anthropocentric Values.\n* **Natural Capitalization Rate**: expresses the relationship between the value of the stocks and flows. This indicator allows for comparison across polygons and ecosystems based on condition, intervention, and underlying real asset market values. Formula: Flows dollar value divided by Stocks dollar value equals the Natural Cap Rate (_indicator_).\n\n## Linking Ecological Indicators & Indices\n\nThe RealValue metrics and indicator can be linked to any assortment of [ecological metrics, variables, indicators and indices](../../appendix/ecological-indicators-and-metrics.md), both quantitative and qualitative, to assess overall ecosystem state, function, and health including biodiversity.\n\n## Examples of RealValue\n\nBefore diving into the details of Ecological Polygons and RealValues, here are some [examples of RealValue and Natural Cap Rates](examples-of-realvalue.md).\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p><a href=\"examples-of-realvalue.md\">Examples of RealValue</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n", "metadata": {"path": "realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/README.md", "sha": "49f46779401ea6f59379c33766bb5d3b7d29caaa", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Ecological Polygon\n\nThe Ecological Polygon serves as the foundational unit of natural capital accounting within the RealValue framework. It is the 'place' of ecological stocks which gives bounty to the ecological flows.\n\nAn ecological polygon can be any size, anywhere in the world, of any ecosystem composition. It can be an arbitrarily drawn or selected polygon, or can be a very specific polygon based on biophysicality, jurisdictional boundaries or property legal description.\n\n{% hint style=\"success\" %}\nIn most cases the property legal description will and should be used as the boundary of an ecological polygon to allow for certification within the BASIN Protocol.\n{% endhint %}\n\n## Main Components\n\nThe ecological polygon has four main components: **extent**, **characteristics**, **condition**, and **on/off record data**.\n\n### Ecosystem Extent\n\nThis is the size and make up of the polygon. It can be in hectares or acres and all ecosystem types present in the polygon should be delineated based on size. If possible, past and future ecosystem composition should be noted and assessed.\n\n### Ecosystem Characteristics\n\nAt a minimum, the land cover and ecosystem types present in the polygon should be delineated using the [BASIN Ecosystems](../../core-benefits/core-benefits-framework/stocks-ecosystems/ecosystem-definitions.md). Other data should also be included such as IUCN Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFG), One Earth Bioregions, and Resolve Ecoregions.\n\n### Ecosystem Condition\n\nThis is an assessment of ecosystem state, function and overall condition. It should be applied to each ecosystem present in the polygon individually. We currently rank each ecosystem on a scale of 1-10 with a 10 being an undisturbed, pristine, fully functioning ecosystem. The condition metric is a multiplier to ecosystem extent and the BASIN RealValues discussed in the next section.\n\n{% hint style=\"info\" %}\n#### **SEEA Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT)**&#x20;\n\nIf time and budget permits, the **SEEA Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT)** should be applied to the polygon.  The ECT assesses:&#x20;\n\n* A: Abiotic: Physical & Chemical characteristics;&#x20;\n* B: Biotic: Compositional, Structural, & Functional characteristics;&#x20;\n* C: Landscape & Seascape characteristics\n\n#### SEED Biocomplexity\n\nSeparately we are hoping to be a beta tester of Crowther Lab ETH Z\u00fcrich's [SEED Biocomplexity](https://seed-index.com/). SEED is a standardized biodiversity index that measures the full complexity of nature. Similar to our 1-10 multiplier, SEED uses a 0-1 scale and assesses the variation and interactions across:\n\n* **Genetic diversity** _within_ species\n* **Species diversity** _between_ species\n* **Ecosystem diversity** _across ecosystems_\n{% endhint %}\n\n### On/Off Record Data\n\nAs much real asset and real property data as possible should be gathered about the polygon, both of record (public) and off record (private). This should include but is in no way limited to title reports, appraisals, surveys, deed, leases, agreements, mineral and energy reports, environmental assessments, property condition reports, ecological assessments, soils reports, zoning designation, flood plain data, and property financials. Other data can also prove useful such as demographic and income reports, crime reports, long term land use master plans and transportation plans. Other qualitative data such as owner, neighbor, and local sentiment about the place and region is also useful.\n\n## Data and Assessment Quality and Confidence\n\nThe range and quality of data for polygons will vary based on location, jurisdiction, ownership, purpose of the assessment and valuation, budget, timeline and many other factors. As RealValue is an estimate of value, data quality is important but not paramount. Best efforts should be made to gather as much data as possible, make the best assessment with reasonable confidence, and then clearly state and disclose the data and methodology.&#x20;\n", "metadata": {"path": "realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/ecological-polygon.md", "sha": "f22499e0cc35f4030226e277dd9e242a96f57ce0", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/ecological-polygon.md"}}, {"content": "# Examples of RealValue\n\nHere are selected expressions of RealValue. **The most current iterations can be found in the** [**BASIN Ensurance Binder**](https://binder.basin.global/)**.**\n\n## Pilot Sites\n\nThese are three sites we have assessed for [Ecological Ensurance](broken-reference).\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/5.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/6.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/7.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n## RealValues Visuals\n\nRealValues for one site expressed in different visuals.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/RealValue ($&#x27;s).PNG\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/real-value-circles.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/RealValue 100 ac of river, wetlands, &#x26; forest in SE US (2) (1).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n", "metadata": {"path": "realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/examples-of-realvalue.md", "sha": "9b3a7248d007ea096ecdc45f58dc6c069994d0bd", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/BASIN-Field-Manual/blob/main/realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/examples-of-realvalue.md"}}, {"content": "# Natural Cap Rate\n\nCapitalization Rates, or Cap Rates, serve as a fundamental tool in real estate investment for valuation and comparison.

These are often referred to as financial value and typically part of the Provisioning category of ecosystem services.\n\n## Public Goods Values\n\nThese are historically considered positive externalities and encapsulate the common benefits that nature provides for free, customarily classified as ecosystem services. These are often referred to as economic values and typically part of the Regulation, Maintenance, or Cultural categories of ecosystem services.\n\n## Core Benefits Reconciliation\n\nWhile 21 Core Benefits were identified, when converted to RealValues based on Anthropocentric or Public Goods classification it takes them down to 18.

Commonly referred to as Net Operating Income (NOI) this can be use and rental income from land or buildings, and income from the provisioning Core Benefits of raw materials, food, and energy. It can also be carbon or biodiversity credit income, Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) sales, or any other actual income produced from the property.\n\n**Public Goods flow values** are the remaining Core Benefits which are commonly referred to as externalities.

Public Goods Values are also called Ecosystem Service Values (ESV).\n\n{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nIt is important to reconcile the Anthropocentric and Public Goods values on a regular basis as to prevent double counting.

See `scripts/temp/deployTld.js` for instructions.\n\n#### Manually verify TLD contract on Etherscan\n\n1. Flatten the code (`npx hardhat flatten <path-to-contract>.sol >> <flat-contract-name>.sol`).\n2. Delete all instances of SPDX Licences except one.\n3. Go to Etherscan and select single file verification.\n4. Turn on optimizations.\n5. Select 0.8.4 for compiler (do not delete other pragma solidity lines in the file, even if they are for a different Solidity version).\n6. Generate the ABI-encoded constructor arguments using this online tool: https://abi.hashex.org/. Make sure you generate all arguments \nneeded in the TLD **constructor**, including the Factory address.\n7. Submit for verification and hope for the best :)\n\n## Audit tools\n\n### Flatten the contracts\n\nMost audit tools will require you to flatten the contracts. This means that all contracts that are defined under the imports will actually be imported into one .sol file, so all code is in one place.\n\nFirst create a new folder called flattened:\n\n```bash\nmkdir flattened\n```\n\nTo flatten a contract, run this command:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat flatten <path-to-contract> >> flattened/<flat-contract-name>.sol\n```\n\nYou may also need to give all contracts in the flattened file the same Solidity version. And you may need to delete all SPDX lines except the very first one.\n\n### Mythril\n\nUse Docker:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker pull mythril/myth\n```\n\nGo to the `flattened` folder and run this command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -v $(pwd):/tmp mythril/myth -v4 analyze /tmp/<flat-contract-name>.sol --max-depth 10\n```\n\nOr, if you don't use Docker, use this command alone:\n\n```bash\nmyth -v4 analyze flattened/PunkForbiddenTlds.sol --max-depth 10\n```\n\nFlags:\n\n- `v4`: verbose\n- `o`: output\n- `a`: address onchain\n- `l`: automatically retrieve dependencies\n- `max-depth`: maximum recursion depth\n\nDocs: https://mythril-classic.readthedocs.io/en/master/security-analysis.html \n\n### Slither\n\nInstall Slither:\n\n```bash\npip3 install slither-analyzer --user\n```\n\nRun it in the `flattened` folder:\n\n```bash\nslither .\n```\n\nDocs: https://github.com/crytic/slither\n\n## Debugging\n\n### Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory\n\nRun `npx hardhat clean` and then `npx hardhat compile`.\n", "metadata": {"path": "README.md", "sha": "3e9c03a924fc6196584a26912bc9c2c389de497d", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/Situs-Protocol/blob/main/README.md"}}, {"content": "# NFT and Tokenbound Account Data Retrieval Script\n\nThis repository contains a Node.js script that fetches NFT data, including ownership and Tokenbound account details, from a specified Ethereum smart contract.

Install the required npm packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install web3 @tokenbound/sdk\n\n## Configuration\nBefore running the script, update the following placeholders in the getAccountData.js file:\n\n- `rpcUrl`: Your Alchemy or other blockchain service providers API URL.\n- `chainId`: The chain ID of the Ethereum network your contract is deployed on.\n- `contractAddress`: The address of your NFT contract.\n- `contractABI`: The ABI of your NFT contract. Ensure it includes all necessary functions.\n\nNOTE: this version does not have handling for burned tokens (non-existing) but that can easily be added to script if you encounter an error\n\n## Usage\nTo run the script, use the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnode getAccountData.js\n```\n\nThe script will output the data to AccountDataResults.json, which will contain an array of objects with details about each token.\n\n### Example of Output Data\nAn example output file AccountDataResultsExample.json is included in the repository. It shows the format of the data produced by the script, including token IDs, owner addresses, account types (EOA or Contract), token names, and Tokenbound Accounts.\n\n# Contributing\nContributions are welcome. If you have suggestions for improving the script or encounter any issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.\n\n# LICENSE\n\nGNU General Public License v3.0\n", "metadata": {"path": "Tools/getAccountData/README.md", "sha": "0d14bbe457e1cbf740e660e79b4dac27a934f764", "source": "https://api.github.com/basin-global/Situs-Protocol/blob/main/Tools/getAccountData/README.md"}}, {"content": "# Onchain Image Metadata Contract\n\nThis repository contains a custom metadata contract designed for the Situs Protocol's onchain accounts, including `.basin`, `.situs`, `.boulder`, among others. It is intended to enhance the metadata handling capabilities for these domains.\n\n**Note:** This contract is also compatible with Punk Domains TLD's, although it has not yet been tested with them.\n\n# Example\n.boulder onchain account [onchain image](https://raw.seadn.io/files/b854d1dd5f89f5154db77692adfaf9c5.svg)\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n      npm install\n\n## SVG Storage\nThe system employs a secondary Solidity file (*.sol) to store images. Specifically, it handles JPG images converted into a Base64 string. Ensure that the Base64 string is less than approximately 25kb to compile and deploy successfully.\n\n## Animation URL\nThis contract utilizes the animationUrl field in conjunction with Tokenbound iframes to display the contents of each onchain account on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible.\n\n## Environment Setup\nCopy the .env.sample file to create a .env file.\nFill in your private information in the newly created .env file.\n\n## Interface Modifications\nYou may need to modify the interface to suit the specific requirements of your deployment or to integrate additional features.\n\n# License\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
